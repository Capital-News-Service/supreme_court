       SESSIONS, ATTORNEY GENERAL v. DIMAYA

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT

No. 15–1498. Argued January 17, 2017—Reargued October 2, 2017—
                     Decided April 17, 2018
The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) virtually guarantees that
  any alien convicted of an “aggravated felony” after entering the Unit-
  ed States will be deported. See </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">8</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §§1227(a)(2)(A)(iii),
  1229b(a)(3), (b)(1)(C). An aggravated felony includes “a crime of vio-
  lence (as defined in [1</pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">8</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §16] . . . ) for which the term of im-
  prisonment [is] at least one year.” §1101(a)(43)(f). Section 16’s defi-
  nition of a crime of violence is divided into two clauses—often
  referred to as the elements clause, §16(a), and the residual clause,
  §16(b). The residual clause, the provision at issue here, defines a
  “crime of violence” as “any other offense that is a felony and that, by
  its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the
  person or property of another may be used in the course of commit-
  ting the offense.” To decide whether a person’s conviction falls within
  the scope of that clause, courts apply the categorical approach. This
  approach has courts ask not whether “the particular facts” underly-
  ing a conviction created a substantial risk, Leocal v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""137725""><a href=""/opinion/137725/leocal-v-ashcroft/""><span class=""volume"">543</span>

  creation of such a risk in each and every case, but whether “the ordi-

     Respondent James Dimaya is a lawful permanent resident of the
  United States with two convictions for first-degree burglary under
  California law. After his second offense, the Government sought to
  deport him as an aggravated felon. An Immigration Judge and the
  Board of Immigration Appeals held that California first-degree bur-
  glary is a “crime of violence” under §16(b). While Dimaya’s appeal
  was pending in the Ninth Circuit, this Court held that a similar re-

     JUSTICE KAGAN delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to
  Parts I, III, IV–B, and V, concluding that §16’s residual clause is un-
  constitutionally vague. Pp. 6–11, 16–25.
     (a) A straightforward application of Johnson effectively resolves
  this case. Section 16(b) has the same two features as ACCA’s residu-
  al clause—an ordinary-case requirement and an ill-defined risk
  threshold—combined in the same constitutionally problematic way.
  To begin, ACCA’s residual clause created “grave uncertainty about
  how to estimate the risk posed by a crime” because it “tie[d] the judi-
  cial assessment of risk” to a speculative hypothesis about the crime’s
  “ordinary case,” but provided no guidance on how to figure out what
  that ordinary case was. 576 U. S., at ___. Compounding that uncer-
  tainty, ACCA’s residual clause layered an imprecise “serious poten-
  tial risk” standard on top of the requisite “ordinary case” inquiry.
  The combination of “indeterminacy about how to measure the risk
  posed by a crime [and] indeterminacy about how much risk it takes
  for the crime to qualify as a violent felony,” id., at ___, resulted in
  “more unpredictability and arbitrariness than the Due Process
  Clause tolerates,” id., at ___. Section 16(b) suffers from those same
  two flaws. Like ACCA’s residual clause, §16(b) calls for a court to
  identify a crime’s “ordinary case” in order to measure the crime’s risk
  but “offers no reliable way” to discern what the ordinary version of
  any offense looks like. Id., at ___. And its “substantial risk” thresh-
  old is no more determinate than ACCA’s “serious potential risk”
  standard. Thus, the same “[t]wo features” that “conspire[d] to make”
  ACCA’s residual clause unconstitutionally vague also exist in §16(b),
  with the same result. Id., at ___. Pp. 6–11.
     (b) The Government identifies three textual discrepancies between
  ACCA’s residual clause and §16(b) that it claims make §16(b) easier
  to apply and thus cure the constitutional infirmity. None, however,
  relates to the pair of features that Johnson found to produce imper-
  missible vagueness or otherwise makes the statutory inquiry more
  determinate. Pp. 16–24.
       (1) First, the Government argues that §16(b)’s express require-
                   Cite as: </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">584</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">____ (2018)                     3

                              Syllabus

ment (absent from ACCA) that the risk arise from acts taken “in the
course of committing the offense,” serves as a “temporal restriction”—
in other words, a court applying §16(b) may not “consider risks aris-
ing after” the offense’s commission is over. Brief for Petitioner 31.
But this is not a meaningful limitation: In the ordinary case of any of-
fense, the riskiness of a crime arises from events occurring during its
commission, not events occurring later. So with or without the tem-
poral language, a court applying the ordinary case approach, whether
in §16’s or ACCA’s residual clause, would do the same thing—ask
what usually happens when a crime is committed. The phrase “in
the course of” makes no difference as to either outcome or clarity and
cannot cure the statutory indeterminacy Johnson described.
  Second, the Government says that the §16(b) inquiry, which focus-
es on the risk of “physical force,” “trains solely” on the conduct typi-
cally involved in a crime. Brief for Petitioner 36. In contrast,
ACCA’s residual clause asked about the risk of “physical injury,”
requiring a second inquiry into a speculative “chain of causation that
could possibly result in a victim’s injury.” Ibid. However, this Court
has made clear that “physical force” means “force capable of causing
physical pain or injury.” Johnson v. United States, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""1732""><a href=""/opinion/1732/johnson-v-united-states/""><span class=""volume"">559</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">133</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">,
140. So under §16(b) too, a court must not only identify the conduct
typically involved in a crime, but also gauge its potential consequenc-
es. Thus, the force/injury distinction does not clarify a court’s analy-
sis of whether a crime qualifies as violent.
     Third, the Government notes that §16(b) avoids the vagueness of
ACCA’s residual clause because it is not preceded by a “confusing list
of exemplar crimes.” Brief for Petitioner 38. Those enumerated
crimes were in fact too varied to assist this Court in giving ACCA’s
residual clause meaning. But to say that they failed to resolve the
clause’s vagueness is hardly to say they caused the problem. Pp. 16–
21.
     (2) The Government also relies on judicial experience with
§16(b), arguing that because it has divided lower courts less often
and resulted in only one certiorari grant, it must be clearer than its
ACCA counterpart. But in fact, a host of issues respecting §16(b)’s
application to specific crimes divide the federal appellate courts. And
while this Court has only heard oral arguments in two §16(b) cases,
this Court vacated the judgments in a number of other §16(b) cases,
remanding them for further consideration in light of ACCA decisions.
Pp. 21–24.
  JUSTICE KAGAN, joined by JUSTICE GINSBURG, JUSTICE BREYER, and
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, concluded in Parts II and IV–A:
  (a) The Government argues that a more permissive form of the
void-for-vagueness doctrine applies than the one Johnson employed
4                           SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                                    Syllabus

    because the removal of an alien is a civil matter rather than a crimi-
    nal case. This Court’s precedent forecloses that argument. In Jor-
    dan v. De George, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""104896""><a href=""/opinion/104896/jordan-v-de-george/""><span class=""volume"">341</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">223</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, the Court considered what vague-
    ness standard applied in removal cases and concluded that, “in view
    of the grave nature of deportation,” the most exacting vagueness
    standard must apply. Id., at 231. Nothing in the ensuing years calls
    that reasoning into question. This Court has reiterated that deporta-
    tion is “a particularly severe penalty,” which may be of greater con-
    cern to a convicted alien than “any potential jail sentence.” Jae Lee v.
    United States, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">582</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">___, ___. Pp. 4–6.
       (b) Section 16(b) demands a categorical, ordinary-case approach.
    For reasons expressed in Johnson, that approach cannot be aban-
    doned in favor of a conduct-based approach, which asks about the
    specific way in which a defendant committed a crime. To begin, the
    Government once again “has not asked [the Court] to abandon the
    categorical approach in residual-clause cases,” suggesting the fact-
    based approach is an untenable interpretation of §16(b). 576 U. S., at
    ___. Moreover, a fact-based approach would generate constitutional
    questions. In any event, §16(b)’s text demands a categorical ap-
    proach. This Court’s decisions have consistently understood lan-
    guage in the residual clauses of both ACCA and §16 to refer to “the
    statute of conviction, not to the facts of each defendant’s conduct.”
    Taylor v. United States, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""112435""><a href=""/opinion/112435/taylor-v-united-states/""><span class=""volume"">495</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">575</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 601. And the words “by its na-
    ture” in §16(b) even more clearly compel an inquiry into an offense’s
    normal and characteristic quality—that is, what the offense ordinari-
    ly entails. Finally, given the daunting difficulties of accurately “re-
    construct[ing],” often many years later, “the conduct underlying [a]
    conviction,” the conduct-based approach’s “utter impracticability”—
    and associated inequities—is as great in §16(b) as in ACCA. John-
    son, 576 U. S., at ___. Pp. 12–15.
       JUSTICE GORSUCH, agreeing that the Immigration and Nationality
    Act provision at hand is unconstitutionally vague for the reasons
    identified in Johnson v. United States, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">576</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">___, concluded that
    the void for vagueness doctrine, at least properly conceived, serves as
    a faithful expression of ancient due process and separation of powers
    principles the Framers recognized as vital to ordered liberty under
    the Constitution. The Government’s argument that a less-than-fair-
    notice standard should apply where (as here) a person faces only civ-
    il, not criminal, consequences from a statute’s operation is unavail-
    ing. In the criminal context, the law generally must afford “ordinary
    people . . . fair notice of the conduct it punishes,” id., at ___, and it is
    hard to see how the Due Process Clause might often require any less
    than that in the civil context. Nor is there any good reason to single
    out civil deportation for assessment under the fair notice standard
                     Cite as: </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">584</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">____ (2018)                   5

  because of the special gravity of its penalty when so many civil laws
  impose so many similarly severe sanctions. Alternative approaches
  that do not concede the propriety of the categorical ordinary case
  analysis are more properly addressed in another case, involving ei-
  ther the Immigration and Nationality Act or another statute, where
  the parties have a chance to be heard. Pp. 1–19.

JEFFERSON B. SESSIONS, III, ATTORNEY GENERAL,
     PETITIONER v. JAMES GARCIA DIMAYA
 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

                                 [April 17, 2018]


   JUSTICE KAGAN announced the judgment of the Court
and delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to
Parts I, III, IV–B, and V, and an opinion with respect to
Parts II and IV–A, in which JUSTICE GINSBURG, JUSTICE
BREYER, and JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR join.
   Three Terms ago, in Johnson v. United States, this
Court held that part of a federal law’s definition of “violent
felony” was impermissibly vague. See </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">576</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">___
(2015). The question in this case is whether a similarly
worded clause in a statute’s definition of “crime of vio-
lence” suffers from the same constitutional defect. Adher-
ing to our analysis in Johnson, we hold that it does.
                              I
  The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) renders
deportable any alien convicted of an “aggravated felony”
after entering the United States.              </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">8</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">.
§1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). Such an alien is also ineligible for
cancellation of removal, a form of discretionary relief
allowing some deportable aliens to remain in the country.
See §§1229b(a)(3), (b)(1)(C). Accordingly, removal is a
virtual certainty for an alien found to have an aggravated
2                       SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                          Opinion of the Court

felony conviction, no matter how long he has previously
resided here.
   The INA defines “aggravated felony” by listing numer-
ous offenses and types of offenses, often with cross-
references to federal criminal statutes. §1101(a)(43); see
Luna Torres v. Lynch, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">578</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at
2). According to one item on that long list, an aggravated
felony includes “a crime of violence (as defined in section
16 of title 18 . . . ) for which the term of imprisonment [is]
at least one year.” §1101(a)(43)(F). The specified statute,
1</pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">8</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §16, provides the federal criminal code’s defini-
tion of “crime of violence.” Its two parts, often known as
the elements clause and the residual clause, cover:
          “(a) an offense that has as an element the use, at-
       tempted use, or threatened use of physical force
       against the person or property of another, or
          “(b) any other offense that is a felony and that, by
       its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical
       force against the person or property of another may be
       used in the course of committing the offense.”
Section 16(b), the residual clause, is the part of the statute
at issue in this case.
   To decide whether a person’s conviction “falls within the
ambit” of that clause, courts use a distinctive form of what
we have called the categorical approach. Leocal v. Ash-
croft, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""137725""><a href=""/opinion/137725/leocal-v-ashcroft/""><span class=""volume"">543</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">1</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 7 (2004). The question, we have ex-
plained, is not whether “the particular facts” underlying a
conviction posed the substantial risk that §16(b) demands.
Ibid. Neither is the question whether the statutory ele-
ments of a crime require (or entail) the creation of such a
risk in each case that the crime covers.1 The §16(b) in-
——————
    1 The
        analysis thus differs from the form of categorical approach used
to determine whether a prior conviction is for a particular listed offense
(say, murder or arson). In that context, courts ask what the elements of
a given crime always require—in effect, what is legally necessary for a
                     Cite as: </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">584</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">____ (2018)                   3

                         Opinion of the Court

quiry instead turns on the “nature of the offense” gener-
ally speaking. Ibid. (referring to §16(b)’s “by its nature”
language). More precisely, §16(b) requires a court to ask
whether “the ordinary case” of an offense poses the requi-
site risk. James v. United States, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""145743""><a href=""/opinion/145743/james-v-united-states/""><span class=""volume"">550</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">192</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 208
(2007); see infra, at 7.
   In the case before us, Immigration Judges employed
that analysis to conclude that respondent James Dimaya
is deportable as an aggravated felon. A native of the
Philippines, Dimaya has resided lawfully in the United
States since 1992. But he has not always acted lawfully
during that time. Twice, Dimaya was convicted of first-
degree burglary under California law. See Cal. Penal
Code Ann. §§459, 460(a). Following his second offense, the
Government initiated a removal proceeding against him.
Both an Immigration Judge and the Board of Immigration
Appeals held that California first-degree burglary is a
“crime of violence” under §16(b). “[B]y its nature,” the
Board reasoned, the offense “carries a substantial risk of
the use of force.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a. Dimaya
sought review in the Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit.
   While his appeal was pending, this Court held unconsti-
tutional part of the definition of “violent felony” in the
Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 1</pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">8</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §924(e).
ACCA prescribes a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence
if a person convicted of being a felon in possession of a
firearm has three prior convictions for a “violent felony.”
§924(e)(1). The definition of that statutory term goes as
follows:
     “any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term ex-
     ceeding one year . . . that—
       “(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or

conviction. See, e.g., Descamps v. United States, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">570</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">254</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 260–261

      a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.”
      §924(e)(2)(B) (emphasis added).
The italicized portion of that definition (like the similar
language of §16(b)) came to be known as the statute’s
residual clause. In Johnson v. United States, the Court
declared that clause “void for vagueness” under the Fifth
Amendment’s Due Process Clause. 576 U. S., at ___–___
(slip op., at 13–14).
   Relying on Johnson, the Ninth Circuit held that §16(b),
as incorporated into the INA, was also unconstitutionally
vague, and accordingly ruled in Dimaya’s favor. See Di-
maya v. Lynch, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">803</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.3d</span> <span class=""page"">1110</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 1120 (2015). Two other

   “The prohibition of vagueness in criminal statutes,” our
decision in Johnson explained, is an “essential” of due
process, required by both “ordinary notions of fair play and
the settled rules of law.” 576 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4)

guards against arbitrary or discriminatory law enforce-
ment by insisting that a statute provide standards to
govern the actions of police officers, prosecutors, juries,
and judges. See Kolender v. Lawson, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""110926""><a href=""/opinion/110926/kolender-v-lawson/""><span class=""volume"">461</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">352</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 357–
358 (1983). In that sense, the doctrine is a corollary of the
separation of powers—requiring that Congress, rather
than the executive or judicial branch, define what conduct
is sanctionable and what is not. Cf. id., at 358, n. 7 (“[I]f
the legislature could set a net large enough to catch all
possible offenders, and leave it to the courts to step inside
and say who could be rightfully detained, [it would] substi-
tute the judicial for the legislative department” (internal
quotation marks omitted)).
   The Government argues that a less searching form of
the void-for-vagueness doctrine applies here than in John-
son because this is not a criminal case. See Brief for Peti-
tioner 13–15. As the Government notes, this Court has
stated that “[t]he degree of vagueness that the Constitu-
tion [allows] depends in part on the nature of the enact-
ment”: In particular, the Court has “expressed greater
tolerance of enactments with civil rather than criminal
penalties because the consequences of imprecision are
qualitatively less severe.” Hoffman Estates v. Flipside,
Hoffman Estates, Inc., </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""110661""><a href=""/opinion/110661/hoffman-estates-v-flipside-hoffman-estates-inc/""><span class=""volume"">455</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">489</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 498–499 (1982). The
removal of an alien is a civil matter. See Arizona v. United
States, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">567</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">387</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 396 (2012). Hence, the Govern-
ment claims, the need for clarity is not so strong; even a
law too vague to support a conviction or sentence may be
good enough to sustain a deportation order. See Brief for
Petitioner 25–26.
   But this Court’s precedent forecloses that argument,
because we long ago held that the most exacting vague-
ness standard should apply in removal cases. In Jordan v.
De George, we considered whether a provision of immigra-
tion law making an alien deportable if convicted of a
“crime involving moral turpitude” was “sufficiently defi-

“is not a criminal statute” (as §16(b) actually is). Id., at
231; supra, at 1–2. Still, we chose to test (and ultimately
uphold) it “under the established criteria of the ‘void for
vagueness’ doctrine” applicable to criminal laws. 341
U. S., at 231. That approach was demanded, we ex-
plained, “in view of the grave nature of deportation,”
ibid.—a “drastic measure,” often amounting to lifelong
“banishment or exile,” ibid. (quoting Fong Haw Tan v.
Phelan, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""104503""><a href=""/opinion/104503/fong-haw-tan-v-phelan/""><span class=""volume"">333</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">6</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 10 (1948)).
   Nothing in the ensuing years calls that reasoning into
question. To the contrary, this Court has reiterated that
deportation is “a particularly severe penalty,” which may
be of greater concern to a convicted alien than “any poten-
tial jail sentence.” Jae Lee v. United States, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">582</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">___,

that as federal immigration law increasingly hinged de-
portation orders on prior convictions, removal proceedings
became ever more “intimately related to the criminal
process.” Chaidez v. United States, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">568</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">342</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 352
(2013) (quoting Padilla, 559 U. S., at 365). What follows,
as Jordan recognized, is the use of the same standard in
the two settings.
   For that reason, the Government cannot take refuge in a
more permissive form of the void-for-vagueness doctrine
than the one Johnson employed. To salvage §16’s residual
clause, even for use in immigration hearings, the Gov-
ernment must instead persuade us that it is materially
clearer than its now-invalidated ACCA counterpart.
That is the issue we next address, as guided by Johnson’s
analysis.
                           III
  Johnson is a straightforward decision, with equally
straightforward application here. Its principal section
                 Cite as: </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">584</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">____ (2018)            7

                     Opinion of the Court

begins as follows: “Two features of [ACCA’s] residual
clause conspire to make it unconstitutionally vague.” 576
U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5). The opinion then identifies
each of those features and explains how their joinder
produced “hopeless indeterminacy,” inconsistent with due
process. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 7). And with that reason-
ing, Johnson effectively resolved the case now before us.
For §16’s residual clause has the same two features as
ACCA’s, combined in the same constitutionally problem-
atic way. Consider those two, just as Johnson described
them:
   “In the first place,” Johnson explained, ACCA’s residual
clause created “grave uncertainty about how to estimate
the risk posed by a crime” because it “tie[d] the judicial
assessment of risk” to a hypothesis about the crime’s
“ordinary case.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 5). Under the
clause, a court focused on neither the “real-world facts”
nor the bare “statutory elements” of an offense. Ibid.
Instead, a court was supposed to “imagine” an “idealized
ordinary case of the crime”—or otherwise put, the court
had to identify the “kind of conduct the ‘ordinary case’ of a
crime involves.” Ibid. But how, Johnson asked, should a
court figure that out? By using a “statistical analysis of
the state reporter? A survey? Expert evidence? Google?
Gut instinct?” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).
ACCA provided no guidance, rendering judicial accounts of
the “ordinary case” wholly “speculative.” Ibid. Johnson
gave as its prime example the crime of attempted bur-
glary. One judge, contemplating the “ordinary case,” would
imagine the “violent encounter” apt to ensue when a
“would-be burglar [was] spotted by a police officer [or]
private security guard.” Id., at ___–___ (slip op., at 5–6).
Another judge would conclude that “any confrontation”
was more “likely to consist of [an observer’s] yelling ‘Who’s
there?’ . . . and the burglar’s running away.” Id., at ___
(slip op., at 6). But how could either judge really know?
8                   SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                     Opinion of the Court

“The residual clause,” Johnson summarized, “offer[ed] no
reliable way” to discern what the ordinary version of any
offense looked like. Ibid. And without that, no one could
tell how much risk the offense generally posed.
   Compounding that first uncertainty, Johnson continued,
was a second: ACCA’s residual clause left unclear what
threshold level of risk made any given crime a “violent
felony.” See ibid. The Court emphasized that this feature
alone would not have violated the void-for-vagueness
doctrine: Many perfectly constitutional statutes use im-
precise terms like “serious potential risk” (as in ACCA’s
residual clause) or “substantial risk” (as in §16’s). The
problem came from layering such a standard on top of the
requisite “ordinary case” inquiry. As the Court explained:
    “[W]e do not doubt the constitutionality of laws that
    call for the application of a qualitative standard such
    as ‘substantial risk’ to real-world conduct; the law is
    full of instances where a man’s fate depends on his es-
    timating rightly . . . some matter of degree[.] The re-
    sidual clause, however, requires application of the ‘se-
    rious potential risk’ standard to an idealized ordinary
    case of the crime. Because the elements necessary to
    determine the imaginary ideal are uncertain[,] this
    abstract inquiry offers significantly less predictability
    than one that deals with the actual . . . facts.” Id., at
    ___ (slip op., at 12) (some internal quotation marks,
    citations, and alterations omitted).
So much less predictability, in fact, that ACCA’s residual
clause could not pass constitutional muster. As the Court
again put the point, in the punch line of its decision: “By
combining indeterminacy about how to measure the risk
posed by a crime with indeterminacy about how much risk
it takes for the crime to qualify as a violent felony, the
residual clause” violates the guarantee of due process. Id.,

                          Opinion of the Court

at ___ (slip op., at 6).3
   Section 16’s residual clause violates that promise in just
the same way. To begin where Johnson did, §16(b) also
calls for a court to identify a crime’s “ordinary case” in
order to measure the crime’s risk. The Government explic-
itly acknowledges that point here. See Brief for Petitioner
11 (“Section 16(b), like [ACCA’s] residual clause, requires
a court to assess the risk posed by the ordinary case of a
particular offense”). And indeed, the Government’s brief-
ing in Johnson warned us about that likeness, observing
that §16(b) would be “equally susceptible to [an] objection”
that focused on the problems of positing a crime’s ordinary
case. Supp. Brief for Respondent, O. T. 2014, No. 13–
7120, pp. 22–23. Nothing in §16(b) helps courts to perform
that task, just as nothing in ACCA did. We can as well
repeat here what we asked in Johnson: How does one go
about divining the conduct entailed in a crime’s ordinary
case? Statistical analyses? Surveys? Experts? Google?
Gut instinct? See Johnson, 576 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at
5); supra, at 7; post, at 16–17 (GORSUCH, J., concurring in
——————
  3 Johnson  also anticipated and rejected a significant aspect of JUSTICE
THOMAS’s dissent in this case. According to JUSTICE THOMAS, a court
may not invalidate a statute for vagueness if it is clear in any of its
applications—as he thinks is true of completed burglary, which is the
offense Dimaya committed. See post, at 16–20. But as an initial
matter, Johnson explained that supposedly easy applications of the
residual clause might not be “so easy after all.” 576 U. S., at ___–___
(slip op., at 10–11). The crime of completed burglary at issue here
illustrates that point forcefully. See id., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (asking
whether “an ordinary burglar invade[s] an occupied home by night or
an unoccupied home by day”); Dimaya v. Lynch, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">803</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.3d</span> <span class=""page"">1110</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 1116,
n. 7 (CA9 2015) (noting that only about seven percent of burglaries
actually involve violence); Cal. Penal Code Ann. §§459, 460 (West 2010)
(sweeping so broadly as to cover even dishonest door-to-door salesmen).
And still more fundamentally, Johnson made clear that our decisions
“squarely contradict the theory that a vague provision is constitutional
merely because there is some conduct that clearly falls within the
provision’s grasp.” 576 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11).
10                      SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                          Opinion of the Court

part and concurring in judgment). And we can as well
reiterate Johnson’s example: In the ordinary case of at-
tempted burglary, is the would-be culprit spotted and
confronted, or scared off by a yell? See post, at 16 (opinion
of GORSUCH, J.) (offering other knotty examples). Once
again, the questions have no good answers; the “ordinary
case” remains, as Johnson described it, an excessively
“speculative,” essentially inscrutable thing. 576 U. S.,
at ___ (slip op., at 5); accord post, at 27 (THOMAS, J.,
dissenting).4
   And §16(b) also possesses the second fatal feature of
ACCA’s residual clause: uncertainty about the level of risk
that makes a crime “violent.” In ACCA, that threshold
was “serious potential risk”; in §16(b), it is “substantial
risk.” See supra, at 2, 4. But the Government does not
argue that the latter formulation is any more determinate
than the former, and for good reason. As THE CHIEF
JUSTICE’s valiant attempt to do so shows, that would be
slicing the baloney mighty thin. See post, at 5–6 (dissent-
ing opinion). And indeed, Johnson as much as equated the
two phrases: Return to the block quote above, and note
how Johnson—as though anticipating this case—refers to
them interchangeably, as alike examples of imprecise
“qualitative standard[s].” See supra, at 8; 576 U. S., at ___
(slip op., at 12). Once again, the point is not that such a
non-numeric standard is alone problematic: In Johnson’s
words, “we do not doubt” the constitutionality of applying

——————
  4 THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s dissent makes light of the difficulty of identify-

ing a crime’s ordinary case. In a single footnote, THE CHIEF JUSTICE
portrays that task as no big deal: Just eliminate the “atypical” cases,
and (presto!) the crime’s nature and risk are revealed. See post, at 5,
n. 1. That rosy view—at complete odds with Johnson—underlies his
whole dissent (and especially, his analysis of how §16(b) applies to
particular offenses, see post, at 7–10). In effect, THE CHIEF JUSTICE is
able to conclude that §16(b) can survive Johnson only by refusing to
acknowledge one of the two core insights of that decision.

                      Opinion of the Court

§16(b)’s “substantial risk [standard] to real-world con-
duct.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (internal quotation marks
omitted). The difficulty comes, in §16’s residual clause
just as in ACCA’s, from applying such a standard to “a
judge-imagined abstraction”—i.e., “an idealized ordinary
case of the crime.” Id., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 6, 12). It is
then that the standard ceases to work in a way consistent
with due process.
   In sum, §16(b) has the same “[t]wo features” that “con-
spire[d] to make [ACCA’s residual clause] unconstitution-
ally vague.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 5). It too “requires a
court to picture the kind of conduct that the crime involves
in ‘the ordinary case,’ and to judge whether that abstrac-
tion presents” some not-well-specified-yet-sufficiently-
large degree of risk. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 4). The result
is that §16(b) produces, just as ACCA’s residual clause did,
“more unpredictability and arbitrariness than the Due
Process Clause tolerates.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6).
                             IV
  The Government and dissents offer two fundamentally
different accounts of how §16(b) can escape unscathed
from our decision in Johnson. JUSTICE THOMAS accepts
that the ordinary-case inquiry makes §16(b) “impossible to
apply.” Post, at 27. His solution is to overthrow our his-
toric understanding of the statute: We should now read
§16(b), he says, to ask about the risk posed by a particular
defendant’s particular conduct. In contrast, the Govern-
ment, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, accepts that §16(b),
as long interpreted, demands a categorical approach,
rather than a case-specific one. They argue only that
“distinctive textual features” of §16’s residual clause make
applying it “more predictable” than its ACCA counter-
part. Brief for Petitioner 28, 29. We disagree with both
arguments.

                                A
  The essentials of JUSTICE THOMAS’s position go as fol-
lows. Section 16(b), he says, cannot have one meaning,
but could have one of two others. See post, at 27. The
provision cannot demand an inquiry merely into the ele-
ments of a crime, because that is the province of §16(a).
See supra, at 2 (setting out §16(a)’s text). But that still
leaves a pair of options: the categorical, ordinary-case
approach and the “underlying-conduct approach,” which
asks about the specific way in which a defendant commit-
ted a crime. Post, at 25. According to JUSTICE THOMAS,
each option is textually viable (although he gives a slight
nod to the latter based on §16(b)’s use of the word “in-
volves”). See post, at 24–26. What tips the scales is that
only one—the conduct approach—is at all “workable.”
Post, at 27. The difficulties of the ordinary-case inquiry,
JUSTICE THOMAS rightly observes, underlie this Court’s
view that §16(b) is too vague. So abandon that inquiry,
JUSTICE THOMAS urges. After all, he reasons, it is the
Court’s “plain duty,” under the constitutional avoidance
canon, to adopt any reasonable construction of a statute
that escapes constitutional problems. Post, at 28–29
(quoting United States ex rel. Attorney General v. Dela-
ware & Hudson Co., </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""97023""><a href=""/opinion/97023/united-states-ex-rel-attorney-general-v-delaware-hudson-co/""><span class=""volume"">213</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">366</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 407 (1909)).
  For anyone who has read Johnson, that argument will
ring a bell. The dissent there issued the same invitation,
based on much the same reasoning, to jettison the categor-
ical approach in residual-clause cases. 576 U. S., at ___–
___ (slip op., at 9–13) (opinion of ALITO, J.). The Court
declined to do so. It first noted that the Government had
not asked us to switch to a fact-based inquiry. It then
observed that the Court “had good reasons” for originally
adopting the categorical approach, based partly on ACCA’s
text (which, by the way, uses the word “involves” identi-
cally) and partly on the “utter impracticability” of the alter-
native. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (majority opinion). “The

only plausible interpretation” of ACCA’s residual clause,
we concluded, “requires use of the categorical approach”—
even if that approach could not in the end satisfy constitu-
tional standards. Ibid. (internal quotation marks and
alteration omitted).
   The same is true here—except more so. To begin where
Johnson did, the Government once again “has not asked
us to abandon the categorical approach in residual-clause
cases.” Ibid. To the contrary, and as already noted, the
Government has conceded at every step the correctness of
that statutory construction. See supra, at 9. And this
time, the Government’s decision is even more noteworthy
than before—precisely because the Johnson dissent laid
out the opposite view, presenting it in prepackaged form
for the Government to take off the shelf and use in the
§16(b) context. Of course, we are not foreclosed from going
down JUSTICE THOMAS’s path just because the Govern-
ment has not done so. But we find it significant that the
Government cannot bring itself to say that the fact-based
approach JUSTICE THOMAS proposes is a tenable interpre-
tation of §16’s residual clause.
   Perhaps one reason for the Government’s reluctance is
that such an approach would generate its own constitu-
tional questions. As JUSTICE THOMAS relates, post, at 22,
28, this Court adopted the categorical approach in part to
“avoid[ ] the Sixth Amendment concerns that would arise
from sentencing courts’ making findings of fact that
properly belong to juries.” Descamps v. United States, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">570</span>
<span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">254</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 267 (2013). JUSTICE THOMAS thinks that issue
need not detain us here because “the right of trial by jury
ha[s] no application in a removal proceeding.” Post, at 28
(internal quotation marks omitted). But although this
particular case involves removal, §16(b) is a criminal
statute, with criminal sentencing consequences.         See
supra, at 2. And this Court has held (it could hardly have
done otherwise) that “we must interpret the statute con-

sistently, whether we encounter its application in a crimi-
nal or noncriminal context.” Leocal, 543 U. S., at 12, n. 8.
So JUSTICE THOMAS’s suggestion would merely ping-pong
us from one constitutional issue to another. And that
means the avoidance canon cannot serve, as he would like,
as the interpretive tie breaker.
   In any event, §16(b)’s text creates no draw: Best read, it
demands a categorical approach. Our decisions have
consistently understood language in the residual clauses
of both ACCA and §16 to refer to “the statute of conviction,
not to the facts of each defendant’s conduct.” Taylor v.
United States, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""112435""><a href=""/opinion/112435/taylor-v-united-states/""><span class=""volume"">495</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">575</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 601 (1990); see Leocal, 543
U. S., at 7 (Section 16 “directs our focus to the ‘offense’ of
conviction . . . rather than to the particular facts”). Simple
references to a “conviction,” “felony,” or “offense,” we have
stated, are “read naturally” to denote the “crime as gener-
ally committed.” Nijhawan v. Holder, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""145861""><a href=""/opinion/145861/nijhawan-v-holder/""><span class=""volume"">557</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">29</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 34
(2009); see Leocal, 543 U. S., at 7; Johnson, 576 U. S., at
___ (slip op., at 13). And the words “by its nature” in
§16(b) make that meaning all the clearer. The statute,
recall, directs courts to consider whether an offense, by its
nature, poses the requisite risk of force. An offense’s
“nature” means its “normal and characteristic quality.”
Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 1507
(2002). So §16(b) tells courts to figure out what an offense
normally—or, as we have repeatedly said, “ordinarily”—
entails, not what happened to occur on one occasion. And
the same conclusion follows if we pay attention to lan-
guage that is missing from §16(b). As we have observed in
the ACCA context, the absence of terms alluding to a
crime’s circumstances, or its commission, makes a fact-
based interpretation an uncomfortable fit. See Descamps,
570 U. S., at 267. If Congress had wanted judges to look
into a felon’s actual conduct, “it presumably would have
said so; other statutes, in other contexts, speak in just that

way.” Id., at 267–268.5 The upshot of all this textual
evidence is that §16’s residual clause—like ACCA’s, except
still more plainly—has no “plausible” fact-based reading.
Johnson, 576 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13).
   And finally, the “utter impracticability”—and associated
inequities—of such an interpretation is as great in the one
statute as in the other. Ibid. This Court has often de-
scribed the daunting difficulties of accurately “recon-
struct[ing],” often many years later, “the conduct underly-
ing [a] conviction.” Ibid.; Descamps, 570 U. S., at 270;
Taylor, 495 U. S., at 601–602. According to JUSTICE
THOMAS, we need not worry here because immigration
judges have some special factfinding talent, or at least
experience, that would mitigate the risk of error attaching
to that endeavor in federal courts. See post, at 30. But we
cannot see putting so much weight on the superior fact-
finding prowess of (notoriously overburdened) immigration
judges. And as we have said before, §16(b) is a criminal
statute with applications outside the immigration context.
See supra, at 2, 13. Once again, then, we have no ground
for discovering a novel interpretation of §16(b) that would
remove us from the dictates of Johnson.

  5 For example, in United States v. Hayes, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""145907""><a href=""/opinion/145907/united-states-v-hayes/""><span class=""volume"">555</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">415</span></a></span><pre class=""inline""> (2009), this
Court held that a firearms statute referring to former crimes as “com-
mitted by” specified persons requires courts to consider underlying
facts. Id., at 421. And in Nijhawan v. Holder, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""145861""><a href=""/opinion/145861/nijhawan-v-holder/""><span class=""volume"">557</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">29</span></a></span><pre class=""inline""> (2009), the
Court similarly adopted a non-categorical interpretation of one of the
aggravated felonies listed in the INA because of the phrase, appended
to the named offense, “in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds
$10,000.” Id., at 34, 36 (emphasis deleted). JUSTICE THOMAS suggests
that Nijhawan rejected the relevance of our ACCA precedents in
interpreting the INA’s aggravated-felony list—including its incorpora-
tion of §16(b). Post, at 29–30. But that misreads the decision. In
Nijhawan, we considered an item on the INA’s list that looks nothing
like ACCA, and we concluded—no surprise here—that our ACCA
decisions did not offer a useful guide. As to items on the INA’s list that
do mirror ACCA, the opposite conclusion of course follows.
16                 SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                     Opinion of the Court 


                            B

  Agreeing that is so, the Government (joined by THE
CHIEF JUSTICE) takes a narrower path to the same desired
result. It points to three textual discrepancies between
ACCA’s residual clause and §16(b), and argues that they
make §16(b) significantly easier to apply. But each turns
out to be the proverbial distinction without a difference.
None relates to the pair of features—the ordinary-case
inquiry and a hazy risk threshold—that Johnson found to
produce impermissible vagueness. And none otherwise
affects the determinacy of the statutory inquiry into
whether a prior conviction is for a violent crime. That is
why, contrary to the Government’s final argument, the
experience of applying both statutes has generated confu-
sion and division among lower courts.
                              1
  The Government first—and foremost—relies on §16(b)’s
express requirement (absent from ACCA) that the risk
arise from acts taken “in the course of committing the
offense.” Brief for Petitioner 31. (THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s
dissent echoes much of this argument. See post, at 6–7.)
Because of that “temporal restriction,” a court applying
§16(b) may not “consider risks arising after” the offense’s
commission is over. Ibid. In the Government’s view,
§16(b)’s text thereby demands a “significantly more fo-
cused inquiry” than did ACCA’s residual clause. Id., at 32.
  To assess that claim, start with the meaning of §16(b)’s
“in the course of ” language. That phrase, understood in
the normal way, includes the conduct occurring through-
out a crime’s commission—not just the conduct sufficient
to satisfy the offense’s formal elements. The Government
agrees with that construction, explaining that the words
“in the course of ” sweep in everything that happens while
a crime continues. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 57–58 (Oct. 2,
2017) (illustrating that idea with reference to conspiracy,
                   Cite as: </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">584</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">____ (2018)             17

                       Opinion of the Court

burglary, kidnapping, and escape from prison). So, for
example, conspiracy may be a crime of violence under
§16(b) because of the risk of force while the conspiracy is
ongoing (i.e., “in the course of ” the conspiracy); it is irrele-
vant that conspiracy’s elements are met as soon as the
participants have made an agreement. See ibid.; United
States v. Doe, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""691314""><a href=""/opinion/691314/united-states-v-john-doe/""><span class=""volume"">49</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.3d</span> <span class=""page"">859</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 866 (CA2 1995). Similarly,
and closer to home, burglary may be a crime of violence
under §16(b) because of the prospects of an encounter
while the burglar remains in a building (i.e., “in the course
of ” the burglary); it does not matter that the elements of
the crime are met at the precise moment of his entry. See
Tr. of Oral Arg. 57–58 (Oct. 2, 2017); James, 550 U. S., at
203. In other words, a court applying §16(b) gets to con-
sider everything that is likely to take place for as long as a
crime is being committed.
   Because that is so, §16(b)’s “in the course of ” language
does little to narrow or focus the statutory inquiry. All
that the phrase excludes is a court’s ability to consider the
risk that force will be used after the crime has entirely
concluded—so, for example, after the conspiracy has dis-
solved or the burglar has left the building. We can con-
struct law-school-type hypotheticals fitting that fact pat-
tern—say, a burglar who constructs a booby trap that
later knocks out the homeowner. But such imaginative
forays cannot realistically affect a court’s view of the
ordinary case of a crime, which is all that matters under
the statute. See supra, at 2–3, 7. In the ordinary case, the
riskiness of a crime arises from events occurring during its
commission, not events occurring later. So with or with-
out §16(b)’s explicit temporal language, a court applying
the section would do the same thing—ask what usually
happens when a crime goes down.
   And that is just what courts did when applying ACCA’s
residual clause—and for the same reason. True, that
clause lacked an express temporal limit. But not a single
18                      SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                          Opinion of the Court

one of this Court’s ACCA decisions turned on conduct that
might occur after a crime’s commission; instead, each
hinged on the risk arising from events that could happen
while the crime was ongoing. See, e.g., Sykes v. United
States, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""218457""><a href=""/opinion/218457/sykes-v-united-states/""><span class=""volume"">564</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">1</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 10 (2011) (assessing the risks attached
to the “confrontations that initiate and terminate” vehicle
flight, along with “intervening” events); Chambers v.
United States, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""145923""><a href=""/opinion/145923/chambers-v-united-states/""><span class=""volume"">555</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">122</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 128 (2009) (rejecting the
Government’s argument that violent incidents “occur[ring]
long after” a person unlawfully failed to report to prison
rendered that crime a violent felony). Nor could those
decisions have done otherwise, given the statute’s concern
with the ordinary (rather than the outlandish) case. Once
again, the riskiness of a crime in the ordinary case de-
pends on the acts taken during—not after—its commis-
sion. Thus, the analyses under ACCA’s residual clause
and §16(b) coincide.
   The upshot is that the phrase “in the course of ” makes
no difference as to either outcome or clarity. Every offense
that could have fallen within ACCA’s residual clause
might equally fall within §16(b). And the difficulty of
deciding whether it does so remains just as intractable.
Indeed, we cannot think of a single federal crime whose
treatment becomes more obvious under §16(b) than under
ACCA because of the words “in the course of.”6 The
——————
  6 In response to repeated questioning at two oral arguments, the Gov-

ernment proposed one (and only one) such crime—but we disagree that
§16(b)’s temporal language would aid in its analysis. According to the
Government, possession of a short-barreled shotgun could count as
violent under ACCA but not under §16(b) because shooting the gun is
“not in the course of committing the crime of possession.” Tr. of Oral
Arg. 59–60 (Oct. 2, 2017); see Tr. of Oral Arg. 6–7 (Jan. 17, 2017); Brief
for Petitioner 32–34. That is just wrong: When a criminal shoots a gun,
he does so while (“in the course of ”) possessing it (except perhaps in
some physics-defying fantasy world). What makes the offense difficult
to classify as violent is something different: that while some people use
the short-barreled shotguns they possess to commit murder, others

                          Opinion of the Court

phrase, then, cannot cure the statutory indeterminacy
Johnson described.
   Second, the Government (and again, THE CHIEF
JUSTICE’s dissent, see post, at 6) observes that §16(b)
focuses on the risk of “physical force” whereas ACCA’s
residual clause asked about the risk of “physical injury.”
The §16(b) inquiry, the Government says, “trains solely”
on the conduct typically involved in a crime. Brief for
Petitioner 36. By contrast, the Government continues,
ACCA’s residual clause required a second inquiry: After
describing the ordinary criminal’s conduct, a court had to
“speculate about a chain of causation that could possibly
result in a victim’s injury.” Ibid. The Government’s con-
clusion is that the §16(b) inquiry is “more specific.” Ibid.
   But once more, we struggle to see how that statutory
distinction would matter. To begin with, the first of the
Government’s two steps—defining the conduct in the
ordinary case—is almost always the difficult part. Once
that is accomplished, the assessment of consequences
tends to follow as a matter of course. So, for example, if a
crime is likely enough to lead to a shooting, it will also be
likely enough to lead to an injury. And still more im-
portant, §16(b) involves two steps as well—and essentially
the same ones. In interpreting statutes like §16(b), this
Court has made clear that “physical force” means “force

merely store them in a nearby firearms cabinet—and it is hard to settle
which is the more likely scenario. Compare Johnson, 576 U. S., at ___–
___ (slip op., at 19–20) (ALITO, J., dissenting) (“It is fanciful to assume
that a person who [unlawfully possesses] a notoriously dangerous
weapon is unlikely to use that weapon in violent ways”), with id., at ___
(slip op., at 4) (THOMAS, J., concurring) (Unlawful possession of a short-
barreled shotgun “takes place in a variety of ways . . . many, perhaps
most, of which do not involve likely accompanying violence” (internal
quotation marks omitted)). But contrary to THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s
suggestion, see post, at 7–8 (which, again, is tied to his disregard of the
ordinary-case inquiry, see supra, at 10, n. 4), that issue must be settled
no less under §16(b) than under ACCA.
20                   SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                      Opinion of the Court

capable of causing physical pain or injury.” Johnson v.
United States, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""1732""><a href=""/opinion/1732/johnson-v-united-states/""><span class=""volume"">559</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">133</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 140 (2010) (defining the term
for purposes of deciding what counts as a “violent” crime).
So under §16(b) too, a court must not only identify the
conduct typically involved in a crime, but also gauge its
potential consequences. Or said a bit differently, evaluat-
ing the risk of “physical force” itself entails considering the
risk of “physical injury.”         For those reasons, the
force/injury distinction is unlikely to affect a court’s analy-
sis of whether a crime qualifies as violent. All the same
crimes might—or, then again, might not—satisfy both
requirements.      Accordingly, this variance in wording
cannot make ACCA’s residual clause vague and §16(b) not.
   Third, the Government briefly notes that §16(b), unlike
ACCA’s residual clause, is not preceded by a “confusing
list of exemplar crimes.” Brief for Petitioner 38. (THE
CHIEF JUSTICE’s dissent reiterates this argument, with
some additional references to our caselaw. See post, at
10–12.) Here, the Government is referring to the offenses
ACCA designated as violent felonies independently of the
residual clause (i.e., burglary, arson, extortion, and use of
explosives). See supra, at 4. According to the Govern-
ment, those crimes provided “contradictory and opaque
indications” of what non-specified offenses should also
count as violent. Brief for Petitioner 38. Because §16(b)
lacks any such enumerated crimes, the Government con-
cludes, it avoids the vagueness of ACCA’s residual clause.
   We readily accept a part of that argument. This Court
for several years looked to ACCA’s listed crimes for help in
giving the residual clause meaning. See, e.g., Begay v.
United States, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""145815""><a href=""/opinion/145815/begay-v-united-states/""><span class=""volume"">553</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">137</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 142 (2008); James, 550 U. S.,
at 203. But to no avail. As the Government relates (and
Johnson explained), the enumerated crimes were them-
selves too varied to provide such assistance. See Brief for
Petitioner 38–40; 576 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12). Trying
to reconcile them with each other, and then compare them

                      Opinion of the Court

to whatever unlisted crime was at issue, drove many a
judge a little batty. And more to the point, the endeavor
failed to bring any certainty to the residual clause’s appli-
cation. See Brief for Petitioner 38–40.
  But the Government’s conclusion does not follow. To
say that ACCA’s listed crimes failed to resolve the residual
clause’s vagueness is hardly to say they caused the prob-
lem. Had they done so, Johnson would not have needed to
strike down the clause. It could simply have instructed
courts to give up on trying to interpret the clause by refer-
ence to the enumerated offenses. (Contrary to THE CHIEF
JUSTICE’s suggestion, see post, at 12, discarding an inter-
pretive tool once it is found not to actually aid in interpre-
tation hardly “expand[s]” the scope of a statute.) That
Johnson went so much further—invalidating a statutory
provision rather than construing it independently of an-
other—demonstrates that the list of crimes was not the
culprit. And indeed, Johnson explicitly said as much. As
described earlier, Johnson found the residual clause’s
vagueness to reside in just “two” of its features: the
ordinary-case requirement and a fuzzy risk standard. See
576 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 5–6); supra, at 7–8.
Strip away the enumerated crimes—as Congress did in
§16(b)—and those dual flaws yet remain. And ditto the
textual indeterminacy that flows from them.
                             2
  Faced with the two clauses’ linguistic similarity, the
Government relies significantly on an argument rooted in
judicial experience. Our opinion in Johnson, the Govern-
ment notes, spoke of the longstanding “trouble” that this
Court and others had in “making sense of [ACCA’s] resid-
ual clause.” 576 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9); see Brief for
Petitioner 45. According to the Government, §16(b) has
not produced “comparable difficulties.” Id., at 46. Lower
courts, the Government claims, have divided less often
22                      SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                          Opinion of the Court

about the provision’s meaning, and as a result this Court
granted certiorari on “only a single Section 16(b) case”
before this one. Ibid.7 “The most likely explanation,” the
Government concludes, is that “Section 16(b) is clearer”
than its ACCA counterpart. Id., at 47.
   But in fact, a host of issues respecting §16(b)’s applica-
tion to specific crimes divide the federal appellate courts.
Does car burglary qualify as a violent felony under §16(b)?
Some courts say yes, another says no.8 What of statutory
rape? Once again, the Circuits part ways.9 How about
evading arrest? The decisions point in different direc-
tions.10 Residential trespass? The same is true.11 Those
examples do not exhaust the current catalogue of Circuit
conflicts concerning §16(b)’s application. See Brief for

  7 And,  THE CHIEF JUSTICE emphasizes, we decided that one unani-
mously! See post, at 3 (discussing Leocal v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""137725""><a href=""/opinion/137725/leocal-v-ashcroft/""><span class=""volume"">543</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">1</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">

                          Opinion of the Court

National Immigration Project of the National Lawyers
Guild et al. as Amici Curiae 7–18 (citing divided appellate
decisions as to the unauthorized use of a vehicle, firearms
possession, and abduction). And that roster would just
expand with time, mainly because, as Johnson explained,
precious few crimes (of the thousands that fill the statute
books) have an obvious, non-speculative—and therefore
undisputed—“ordinary case.” See 576 U. S., at ___–___
(slip op., at 5–6).
   Nor does this Court’s prior handling of §16(b) cases
support the Government’s argument. To be sure, we have
heard oral argument in only two cases arising from §16(b)
(including this one), as compared with five involving
ACCA’s residual clause (including Johnson).12 But while
some of those ACCA suits were pending before us, we
received a number of petitions for certiorari presenting
related issues in the §16(b) context. And after issuing the
relevant ACCA decisions, we vacated the judgments in
those §16(b) cases and remanded them for further consid-
eration.13 That we disposed of the ACCA and §16(b) peti-
——————
  12 From    all we can tell—and all the Government has told us, see Brief
for Petitioner 45–52—lower courts have also decided many fewer cases
involving §16(b) than ACCA’s residual clause. That disparity likely
reflects the Government’s lesser need to rely on §16(b). That provision
is mainly employed (as here) in the immigration context, to establish an
“aggravated felony” requiring deportation. See supra, at 2. But immi-
gration law offers many other ways to achieve that result. The INA
lists 80 or so crimes that count as aggravated felonies; only if a convic-
tion is not for one of those specified offenses need the Government
resort to §16(b) (or another catch-all provision). See Luna Torres v.
Lynch, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">578</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 2). By contrast, ACCA
enumerates only four crimes as a basis for enhancing sentences; the
Government therefore had reason to use the statute’s residual clause
more often.

tions in that order, rather than its opposite, provides no
reason to disregard the indeterminacy that §16(b) shares
with ACCA’s residual clause.
   And of course, this Court’s experience in deciding ACCA
cases only supports the conclusion that §16(b) is too vague.
For that record reveals that a statute with all the same
hallmarks as §16(b) could not be applied with the predict-
ability the Constitution demands. See id., at ___–___ (slip
op., at 6–9); supra, at 6–9. The Government would con-
demn us to repeat the past—to rerun the old ACCA tape,
as though we remembered nothing from its first showing.
But why should we disregard a lesson so hard learned?
“Insanity,” Justice Scalia wrote in the last ACCA residual
clause case before Johnson, “is doing the same thing over
and over again, but expecting different results.” Sykes,
564 U. S., at 28 (dissenting opinion). We abandoned that
lunatic practice in Johnson and see no reason to start it
again.
                               V
   Johnson tells us how to resolve this case. That decision
held that “[t]wo features of [ACCA’s] residual clause con-
spire[d] to make it unconstitutionally vague.” 576 U. S.,
at ___ (slip op., at 5). Because the clause had both an
ordinary-case requirement and an ill-defined risk thresh-
old, it necessarily “devolv[ed] into guesswork and intui-
tion,” invited arbitrary enforcement, and failed to provide
fair notice. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 8). Section 16(b) pos-
sesses the exact same two features. And none of the minor
linguistic disparities in the statutes makes any real differ-
ence. So just like ACCA’s residual clause, §16(b) “produc-
es more unpredictability and arbitrariness than the Due
Process Clause tolerates.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6). We

JEFFERSON B. SESSIONS, III, ATTORNEY GENERAL,
     PETITIONER v. JAMES GARCIA DIMAYA
 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

                     [April 17, 2018] 


   JUSTICE GORSUCH, concurring in part and concurring in
the judgment.
   Vague laws invite arbitrary power. Before the Revolu­
tion, the crime of treason in English law was so capa­
ciously construed that the mere expression of disfavored
opinions could invite transportation or death. The founders
cited the crown’s abuse of “pretended” crimes like this as
one of their reasons for revolution. See Declaration of
Independence ¶21. Today’s vague laws may not be as
invidious, but they can invite the exercise of arbitrary
power all the same—by leaving the people in the dark
about what the law demands and allowing prosecutors and
courts to make it up.
   The law before us today is such a law. Before holding a
lawful permanent resident alien like James Dimaya sub­
ject to removal for having committed a crime, the Immi­
gration and Nationality Act requires a judge to determine
that the ordinary case of the alien’s crime of conviction
involves a substantial risk that physical force may be
used. But what does that mean? Just take the crime at
issue in this case, California burglary, which applies to
everyone from armed home intruders to door-to-door
salesmen peddling shady products. How, on that vast
spectrum, is anyone supposed to locate the ordinary case
and say whether it includes a substantial risk of physical
force? The truth is, no one knows. The law’s silence
2                   SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                    Opinion of GORSUCH, J.

leaves judges to their intuitions and the people to their
fate. In my judgment, the Constitution demands more.
                              *
   I begin with a foundational question. Writing for the
Court in Johnson v. United States, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">576</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">___ (2015),
Justice Scalia held the residual clause of the Armed Ca­
reer Criminal Act void for vagueness because it invited
“more unpredictability and arbitrariness” than the Consti­
tution allows. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6). Because the
residual clause in the statute now before us uses almost
exactly the same language as the residual clause in John-
son, respect for precedent alone would seem to suggest
that both clauses should suffer the same judgment.
   But first in Johnson and now again today JUSTICE
THOMAS has questioned whether our vagueness doctrine
can fairly claim roots in the Constitution as originally
understood. See, e.g., post, at 2–6 (dissenting opinion);
Johnson, supra, at ___–___ (opinion concurring in judg­
ment) (slip op., at 6–18). For its part, the Court has yet to
offer a reply. I believe our colleague’s challenge is a seri­
ous and thoughtful one that merits careful attention. At
day’s end, though, it is a challenge to which I find my-
self unable to subscribe. Respectfully, I am persuaded in-
stead that void for vagueness doctrine, at least properly
conceived, serves as a faithful expression of ancient due
process and separation of powers principles the
framers recognized as vital to ordered liberty under our
Constitution.
   Consider first the doctrine’s due process underpinnings.
The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments guarantee that
“life, liberty, or property” may not be taken “without due
process of law.” That means the government generally
may not deprive a person of those rights without affording
him the benefit of (at least) those “customary procedures
to which freemen were entitled by the old law of England.”

(Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (internal quotation
marks omitted). Admittedly, some have suggested that
the Due Process Clause does less work than this, allowing
the government to deprive people of their liberty through
whatever procedures (or lack of them) the government’s
current laws may tolerate. Post, at 3, n. 1 (opinion of
THOMAS, J.) (collecting authorities). But in my view the
weight of the historical evidence shows that the clause
sought to ensure that the people’s rights are never any
less secure against governmental invasion than they were
at common law. Lord Coke took this view of the English
due process guarantee. 1 E. Coke, The Second Part of the
Institutes of the Laws of England 50 (1797). John
Rutledge, our second Chief Justice, explained that Coke’s
teachings were carefully studied and widely adopted by
the framers, becoming “ ‘almost the foundations of our
law.’ ” Klopfer v. North Carolina, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""107369""><a href=""/opinion/107369/klopfer-v-north-carolina/""><span class=""volume"">386</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">213</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 225
(1967). And many more students of the Constitution
besides—from Justice Story to Justice Scalia—have
agreed that this view best represents the original under­
standing of our own Due Process Clause. See, e.g., Mur-
ray’s Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co., </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""87010""><a href=""/opinion/87010/murrays-lessee-v-hoboken-land-improvement-co/""><span class=""volume"">18</span> <span class=""reporter"">How.</span>

Mut., supra, at 28–29 (opinion of Scalia, J.); Eberle, Proce­
dural Due Process: The Original Understanding, 4 Const.
Comment. 339, 341 (1987).
  Perhaps the most basic of due process’s customary
protections is the demand of fair notice. See Connally v.
General Constr. Co., </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""100759""><a href=""/opinion/100759/connally-v-general-constr-co/""><span class=""volume"">269</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">385</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 391 (1926); see also
Note, Textualism as Fair Notice, 123 Harv. L. Rev. 542,
543 (2009) (“From the inception of Western culture, fair
notice has been recognized as an essential element of the
rule of law”). Criminal indictments at common law had to
provide “precise and sufficient certainty” about the charges
4                   SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                    Opinion of GORSUCH, J.

involved. 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws
of England 301 (1769) (Blackstone). Unless an “offence
[was] set forth with clearness and certainty,” the indict­
ment risked being held void in court. Id., at 302 (empha­
sis deleted); 2 W. Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown, ch. 25,
§§99, 100, pp. 244–245 (2d ed. 1726) (“[I]t seems to have
been anciently the common practice, where an indictment
appeared to be [in]sufficient, either for its uncertainty or
the want of proper legal words, not to put the defendant to
answer it”).
   The same held true in civil cases affecting a person’s
life, liberty, or property. A civil suit began by obtaining a
writ—a detailed and specific form of action asking for
particular relief. Bellia, Article III and the Cause of Ac­
tion, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">89</span> <span class=""reporter"">Iowa</span> <span class=""page"">L</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. Rev. 777, 784–786 (2004); Subrin, How
Equity Conquered Common Law: The Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure in Historical Perspective, 135 U. Pa. L.
Rev. 909, 914–915 (1987). Because the various civil writs
were clearly defined, English subjects served with one
would know with particularity what legal requirement
they were alleged to have violated and, accordingly, what
would be at issue in court. Id., at 917; Moffitt, Pleadings
in the Age of Settlement, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">80</span> <span class=""reporter"">Ind.</span> <span class=""page"">L</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. J. 727, 731 (2005).
And a writ risked being held defective if it didn’t provide
fair notice. Goldington v. Bassingburn, Y. B. Trin. </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">3</span> <span class=""reporter"">Edw. Ch.</span>
<span class=""page"">II</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, f. 27b (1310) (explaining that it was “the law of the
land” that “no one [could] be taken by surprise” by having
to “answer in court for what [one] has not been warned to
answer”).
   The requirement of fair notice applied to statutes too.
Blackstone illustrated the point with a case involving a
statute that made “stealing sheep, or other cattle” a fel-
ony. 1 Blackstone 88 (emphasis deleted). Because the term
“cattle” embraced a good deal more then than it does now
(including wild animals, no less), the court held the stat­
ute failed to provide adequate notice about what it did and
                      Cite as: </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">584</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">____ (2018)                     5

                         Opinion of GORSUCH, J.

did not cover—and so the court treated the term “cattle” as
a nullity. Ibid. All of which, Blackstone added, had the
salutary effect of inducing the legislature to reenter the
field and make itself clear by passing a new law extending
the statute to “bulls, cows, oxen,” and more “by name.”
Ibid.
   This tradition of courts refusing to apply vague statutes
finds parallels in early American practice as well. In The
Enterprise, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">8</span> <span class=""reporter"">F. Cas.</span> <span class=""page"">732</span></span><pre class=""inline""> (No. 4,499) (CC NY 1810), for
example, Justice Livingston found that a statute setting
the circumstances in which a ship may enter a port during
an embargo was too vague to be applied, concluding that
“the court had better pass” the statutory terms by “as
unintelligible and useless” rather than “put on them, at
great uncertainty, a very harsh signification, and one
which the legislature may never have designed.” Id., at
735. In United States v. Sharp, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">27</span> <span class=""reporter"">F. Cas.</span> <span class=""page"">1041</span></span><pre class=""inline""> (No.
16,264) (CC Pa. 1815), Justice Washington confronted a
statute which prohibited seamen from making a “revolt.”
Id., at 1043. But he was unable to determine the meaning
of this provision “by any authority . . . either in the com­
mon, admiralty, or civil law.” Ibid. As a result, he de­
clined to “recommend to the jury, to find the prisoners
guilty of making, or endeavouring to make a revolt, how­
ever strong the evidence may be.” Ibid.1
——————
   1 Many state courts also held vague laws ineffectual. See, e.g., State

v. Mann, 2 Ore. 238, 240–241 (1867) (holding statute that prohibited
“gambling devices” was “void” because “the term has no settled and
definite meaning”); Drake v. Drake, 15 N. C. 110, 115 (1833) (explaining
that “if the terms in which [a statute] is couched be so vague as to
convey no definite meaning to those whose duty it is to execute it . . . it
is necessarily inoperative”); McConvill v. Mayor and Aldermen of Jersey
City, 39 N. J. L. 38, 44 (1876) (holding that an ordinance was “bad for
vagueness and uncertainty in the thing forbidden”); State v. Boon, 1
N. C. 103, 105 (1801) (refusing to apply a statute because “no punish­
ment whatever can be inflicted; without using a discretion and indulg­
ing a latitude, which in criminal cases ought never to be allowed a

                        Opinion of GORSUCH, J.

  Nor was the concern with vague laws confined to the
most serious offenses like capital crimes. Courts refused
to apply vague laws in criminal cases involving relatively
modest penalties. See, e.g., McJunkins v. State, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">10</span> <span class=""reporter"">Ind.</span>
<span class=""page"">140</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 145 (1858). They applied the doctrine in civil cases
too. See, e.g., Drake v. Drake, 15 N. C. 110, 115 (1833);
Commonwealth v. Bank of Pennsylvania, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">3</span> <span class=""reporter"">Watts & Serg.</span>
<span class=""page"">173</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 177 (Pa. 1842). As one court put it, “all laws” “ought
to be expressed in such a manner as that its meaning may
be unambiguous, and in such language as may be readily
understood by those upon whom it is to operate.”
McConvill v. Mayor and Aldermen of Jersey City, 39
N. J. L. 38, 42 (1876). “ ‘It is impossible . . . to dissent from
the doctrine of Lord Coke, that acts of parliament ought to
be plainly and clearly, and not cunningly and darkly
penned, especially in penal matters.’ ” Id., at 42–43.
  These early cases, admittedly, often spoke in terms of
construing vague laws strictly rather than declaring them
void. See, e.g., post, at 4–5 (opinion of THOMAS, J.); John-
son, 576 U. S., at ___–___ (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (slip op.,
at 8–10). But in substance void the law is often exactly

                    Opinion of GORSUCH, J.

what these courts did: rather than try to construe or in­
terpret the statute before them, judges frequently held the
law simply too vague to apply. Blackstone, for example,
did not suggest the court in his illustration should have
given a narrowing construction to the term “cattle,” but
argued against giving it any effect at all. 1 Blackstone 88;
see also Scalia, Assorted Canards of Contemporary Legal
Analysis, 40 Case W. Res. L. Rev. 581, 582 (1989) (“I doubt
. . . that any modern court would go to the lengths de­
scribed by Blackstone in its application of the rule that
penal statutes are to be strictly construed”); Note, Indefi­
nite Criteria of Definiteness in Statutes, 45 Harv. L. Rev.
160, n. 3 (1931) (explaining that “since strict construction,
in effect, nullified ambiguous provisions, it was but a short
step to declaring them void ab initio”); supra, at 5, n. 1
(state courts holding vague statutory terms “void” or
“null”).
    What history suggests, the structure of the Constitution
confirms. Many of the Constitution’s other provisions
presuppose and depend on the existence of reasonably
clear laws. Take the Fourth Amendment’s requirement
that arrest warrants must be supported by probable cause,
and consider what would be left of that requirement if the
alleged crime had no meaningful boundaries. Or take the
Sixth Amendment’s mandate that a defendant must be
informed of the accusations against him and allowed to
bring witnesses in his defense, and consider what use
those rights would be if the charged crime was so vague
the defendant couldn’t tell what he’s alleged to have done
and what sort of witnesses he might need to rebut that
charge. Without an assurance that the laws supply fair
notice, so much else of the Constitution risks becoming
only a “parchment barrie[r]” against arbitrary power.
The Federalist No. 48, p. 308 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J.
Madison).
    Although today’s vagueness doctrine owes much to the

guarantee of fair notice embodied in the Due Process
Clause, it would be a mistake to overlook the doctrine’s
equal debt to the separation of powers. The Constitution
assigns “[a]ll legislative Powers” in our federal govern­
ment to Congress. Art. I, §1. It is for the people, through
their elected representatives, to choose the rules that will
govern their future conduct. See The Federalist No. 78, at
465 (A. Hamilton) (“The legislature . . . prescribes the
rules by which the duties and rights of every citizen are to
be regulated”). Meanwhile, the Constitution assigns to
judges the “judicial Power” to decide “Cases” and “Contro­
versies.” Art. III, §2. That power does not license judges
to craft new laws to govern future conduct, but only to
“discer[n] the course prescribed by law” as it currently
exists and to “follow it” in resolving disputes between the
people over past events. Osborn v. Bank of United States,

  From this division of duties, it comes clear that legisla­
tors may not “abdicate their responsibilities for setting the
standards of the criminal law,” Smith v. Goguen, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""108988""><a href=""/opinion/108988/smith-v-goguen/""><span class=""volume"">415</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span>

enough to catch all possible offenders, and leave it to the
courts to step inside and say who could be rightfully de­
tained, and who should be set at large[,] [t]his would, to
some extent, substitute the judicial for the legislative

judges to assume legislative power. Vague laws also
threaten to transfer legislative power to police and prose­
cutors, leaving to them the job of shaping a vague statute’s
contours through their enforcement decisions.             See

                     Opinion of GORSUCH, J.

(“A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy mat­
ters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an
ad hoc and subjective basis”).
  These structural worries are more than just formal ones.
Under the Constitution, the adoption of new laws restrict­
ing liberty is supposed to be a hard business, the product
of an open and public debate among a large and diverse
number of elected representatives. Allowing the legisla­
ture to hand off the job of lawmaking risks substituting
this design for one where legislation is made easy, with a
mere handful of unelected judges and prosecutors free to
“condem[n] all that [they] personally disapprove and for no
better reason than [they] disapprove it.” Jordan, supra, at
242 (Jackson, J., dissenting). Nor do judges and prosecu­
tors act in the open and accountable forum of a legislature,
but in the comparatively obscure confines of cases and
controversies. See, e.g., A. Bickel, The Least Dangerous
Branch: The Supreme Court at the Bar of Politics 151
(1962) (“A vague statute delegates to administrators,
prosecutors, juries, and judges the authority of ad hoc
decision, which is in its nature difficult if not impossible to
hold to account, because of its narrow impact”). For just
these reasons, Hamilton warned, while “liberty can have
nothing to fear from the judiciary alone,” it has “every
thing to fear from” the union of the judicial and legislative
powers. The Federalist No. 78, at 466. No doubt, too, for
reasons like these this Court has held “that the more
important aspect of vagueness doctrine ‘is not actual
notice, but . . . the requirement that a legislature establish
minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement’ ” and keep
the separate branches within their proper spheres.

footing in the original understanding of the Constitution,
the next question I confront concerns the standard of
review. What degree of imprecision should this Court
tolerate in a statute before declaring it unconstitutionally
vague? For its part, the government argues that where
(as here) a person faces only civil, not criminal, conse­
quences from a statute’s operation, we should declare the
law unconstitutional only if it is “unintelligible.” But in
the criminal context this Court has generally insisted that
the law must afford “ordinary people . . . fair notice of the
conduct it punishes.” Johnson, 576 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,
at 3). And I cannot see how the Due Process Clause might
often require any less than that in the civil context either.
Fair notice of the law’s demands, as we’ve seen, is “the
first essential of due process.” Connally, 269 U. S., at 391.
And as we’ve seen, too, the Constitution sought to pre­
serve a common law tradition that usually aimed to en­
sure fair notice before any deprivation of life, liberty, or
property could take place, whether under the banner of
the criminal or the civil law. See supra, at 2–7.
   First principles aside, the government suggests that at
least this Court’s precedents support adopting a less-than­
fair-notice standard for civil cases. But even that much I
do not see. This Court has already expressly held that a
“stringent vagueness test” should apply to at least some
civil laws—those abridging basic First Amendment free­
doms. Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc.,
</pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""110661""><a href=""/opinion/110661/hoffman-estates-v-flipside-hoffman-estates-inc/""><span class=""volume"">455</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">489</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 499 (1982). This Court has made clear, too,
that due process protections against vague laws are “not to
be avoided by the simple label a State chooses to fasten
upon its conduct or its statute.” Giaccio v. Pennsylvania,
</pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">382</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">399</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 402 (1966). So the happenstance that a law
is found in the civil or criminal part of the statute books
cannot be dispositive. To be sure, this Court has also said
that what qualifies as fair notice depends “in part on the
nature of the enactment.” Hoffman Estates, 455 U. S., at
                 Cite as: </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">584</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">____ (2018)          11

                    Opinion of GORSUCH, J.

498. And the Court has sometimes “expressed greater
tolerance of enactments with civil rather than criminal
penalties because the consequences of imprecision are
qualitatively less severe.” Id., at 498–499. But to
acknowledge these truisms does nothing to prove that civil
laws must always be subject to the government’s emaci­
ated form of review.
   In fact, if the severity of the consequences counts when
deciding the standard of review, shouldn’t we also take
account of the fact that today’s civil laws regularly impose
penalties far more severe than those found in many crimi­
nal statutes? Ours is a world filled with more and more
civil laws bearing more and more extravagant punish­
ments.      Today’s “civil” penalties include confiscatory
rather than compensatory fines, forfeiture provisions that
allow homes to be taken, remedies that strip persons of
their professional licenses and livelihoods, and the power
to commit persons against their will indefinitely. Some of
these penalties are routinely imposed and are routinely
graver than those associated with misdemeanor crimes—
and often harsher than the punishment for felonies. And
not only are “punitive civil sanctions . . . rapidly expand­
ing,” they are “sometimes more severely punitive than the
parallel criminal sanctions for the same conduct.” Mann,
Punitive Civil Sanctions: The Middleground Between
Criminal and Civil Law, 101 Yale L. J. 1795, 1798 (1992)
(emphasis added). Given all this, any suggestion that
criminal cases warrant a heightened standard of review
does more to persuade me that the criminal standard
should be set above our precedent’s current threshold than
to suggest the civil standard should be buried below it.
   Retreating to a more modest line of argument, the gov­
ernment emphasizes that this case arises in the immigra­
tion context and so implicates matters of foreign relations
where the Executive enjoys considerable constitutional
authority. But to acknowledge that the President has
12                       SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                         Opinion of GORSUCH, J.

broad authority to act in this general area supplies no
justification for allowing judges to give content to an im­
permissibly vague law.
   Alternatively still, JUSTICE THOMAS suggests that, at
least at the time of the founding, aliens present in this
country may not have been understood as possessing any
rights under the Due Process Clause. For support, he
points to the Alien Friends Act of 1798. An Act Concern­
ing Aliens §1, 1 Stat. 571; post, at 6–12 (opinion of
THOMAS, J.). But the Alien Friends Act—better known as
the “Alien” part of the Alien and Sedition Acts—is one of
the most notorious laws in our country’s history. It was
understood as a temporary war measure, not one that the
legislature would endorse in a time of tranquility. See,
e.g., Fehlings, Storm on the Constitution: The First Depor­
tation Law, 10 Tulsa J. Comp. & Int’l L. 63, 70–71 (2002).
Yet even then it was widely condemned as unconstitution­
al by Madison and many others. It also went unenforced,
may have cost the Federalist Party its existence, and
lapsed a mere two years after its enactment. With this
fuller view, it seems doubtful the Act tells us a great deal
about aliens’ due process rights at the founding.2

  Besides, none of this much matters. Whether Madison
or his adversaries had the better of the debate over the
constitutionality of the Alien Friends Act, Congress is
surely free to extend existing forms of liberty to new classes
of persons—liberty that the government may then take
only after affording due process. See, e.g., Sandin v. Con-
ner, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""117957""><a href=""/opinion/117957/sandin-v-conner/""><span class=""volume"">515</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">472</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 477–478 (1995); Easterbrook, Sub­
stance and Due Process, 1982 S. Ct. Rev. 85, 88 (“If . . . the
constitution, statute, or regulation creates a liberty or
property interest, then the second step—determining
‘what process is due’—comes into play”). Madison made
this very point, suggesting an alien’s admission in this
country could in some circumstances be analogous to “the
grant of land to an individual,” which “may be of favor not
of right; but the moment the grant is made, the favor
becomes a right, and must be forfeited before it can be
taken away.” Madison’s Report 319. And, of course, that’s
exactly what Congress eventually chose to do here. Dec­
ades ago, it enacted a law affording Mr. Dimaya lawful
permanent residency in this country, extending to him a

deprivation of a statutorily afforded liberty interest like
this may pose serious and debatable questions. Cf. Mur-
ray’s Lessee, 18 How., at 277 (approving summary proce­
dures in another context). But however summary those
procedures might be, it’s hard to fathom why fair notice of
the law—the most venerable of due process’s require-
ments—would not be among them. Connally, 269 U. S., at

  3 This Court already and long ago held that due process requires af­

fording aliens the “opportunity, at some time, to be heard” before some
lawful authority in advance of removal—and it’s unclear how that
opportunity might be meaningful without fair notice of the law’s
demands. The Japanese Immigrant Case, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""95830""><a href=""/opinion/95830/the-japanese-immigrant-case/""><span class=""volume"">189</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">86</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 101 (1903). Nor
do the cases JUSTICE THOMAS cites hold that a statutory right to lawful
permanent residency in this country can be withdrawn without due
process. Post, at 11 (dissenting opinion). Rather, each merely holds
that the particular statutory removal procedures under attack com­
ported with due process. See Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">342</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">580</span></span><pre class=""inline"">,

that Congress had not authorized the officials to abrogate.” Nelson,

incumbent on any executive official to determine that the alien commit­
ted a qualifying crime and statutory vagueness could pose a disabling
problem even there.

                     Opinion of GORSUCH, J.

   Today, a plurality of the Court agrees that we should
reject the government’s plea for a feeble standard of re­
view, but for a different reason. Ante, at 5–6. My col­
leagues suggest the law before us should be assessed
under the fair notice standard because of the special grav-
ity of its civil deportation penalty. But, grave as that
penalty may be, I cannot see why we would single it out
for special treatment when (again) so many civil laws
today impose so many similarly severe sanctions. Why,
for example, would due process require Congress to speak
more clearly when it seeks to deport a lawfully resident
alien than when it wishes to subject a citizen to indefinite
civil commitment, strip him of a business license essential
to his family’s living, or confiscate his home? I can think
of no good answer.
                               *
  With the fair notice standard now in hand, all that
remains is to ask how it applies to the case before us. And
here at least the answer comes readily for me: to the
extent it requires an “ordinary case” analysis, the portion
of the Immigration and Nationality Act before us fails the
fair notice test for the reasons Justice Scalia identified in
Johnson and the Court recounts today.
  Just like the statute in Johnson, the statute here in­
structs courts to impose special penalties on individuals
previously “convicted of” a “crime of violence.” </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">8</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">.
§§1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), 1101(a)(43)(F). Just like the statute in
Johnson, the statute here fails to specify which crimes
qualify for that label. Instead, and again like the statute
in Johnson, the statute here seems to require a judge to
guess about the ordinary case of the crime of conviction
and then guess whether a “substantial risk” of “physical
force” attends its commission. 1</pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">8</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §16(b); Johnson,
576 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 4–5). Johnson held that
a law that asks so much of courts while offering them so
16                  SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                    Opinion of GORSUCH, J.

little by way of guidance is unconstitutionally vague. And
I do not see how we might reach a different judgment
here.
   Any lingering doubt is resolved for me by taking account
of just some of the questions judges trying to apply the
statute using an ordinary case analysis would have to
confront. Does a conviction for witness tampering ordinar­
ily involve a threat to the kneecaps or just the promise of a
bribe? Does a conviction for kidnapping ordinarily involve
throwing someone into a car trunk or a noncustodial par­
ent picking up a child from daycare? These questions do
not suggest obvious answers. Is the court supposed to
hold evidentiary hearings to sort them out, entertaining
experts with competing narratives and statistics, before
deciding what the ordinary case of a given crime looks like
and how much risk of violence it poses? What is the judge
to do if there aren’t any reliable statistics available?
Should (or must) the judge predict the effects of new tech­
nology on what qualifies as the ordinary case? After all,
surely the risk of injury calculus for crimes like larceny
can be expected to change as more thefts are committed by
computer rather than by gunpoint. Or instead of requir­
ing real evidence, does the statute mean to just leave it all
to a judicial hunch? And on top of all that may be the
most difficult question yet: at what level of generality is
the inquiry supposed to take place? Is a court supposed to
pass on the ordinary case of burglary in the relevant
neighborhood or county, or should it focus on statewide or
even national experience? How is a judge to know? How
are the people to know?
   The implacable fact is that this isn’t your everyday
ambiguous statute. It leaves the people to guess about
what the law demands—and leaves judges to make it up.
You cannot discern answers to any of the questions this
law begets by resorting to the traditional canons of statu­
tory interpretation. No amount of staring at the statute’s
                 Cite as: </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">584</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">____ (2018)           17

                    Opinion of GORSUCH, J.

text, structure, or history will yield a clue. Nor does the
statute call for the application of some preexisting body of
law familiar to the judicial power. The statute doesn’t
even ask for application of common experience. Choice,
pure and raw, is required. Will, not judgment, dictates the
result.
                               *
  Having said this much, it is important to acknowledge
some limits on today’s holding too. I have proceeded on
the premise that the Immigration and Nationality Act, as
it incorporates §16(b) of the criminal code, commands
courts to determine the risk of violence attending the
ordinary case of conviction for a particular crime. I have
done so because no party before us has argued for a differ­
ent way to read these statutes in combination; because our
precedent seemingly requires this approach; and because
the government itself has conceded (repeatedly) that the
law compels it. Johnson, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 13);
Taylor v. United States, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""112435""><a href=""/opinion/112435/taylor-v-united-states/""><span class=""volume"">495</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">575</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 600 (1990); Brief for
Petitioner 11, 30, 32, 36, 40, 47 (conceding that an ordi­
nary case analysis is required).
  But any more than that I would not venture. In re­
sponse to the problems engendered by the ordinary case
analysis, JUSTICE THOMAS suggests that we should over­
look the government’s concession about the propriety of
that approach; reconsider our precedents endorsing it; and
read the statute as requiring us to focus on the facts of the
alien’s crime as committed rather than as the facts appear
in the ordinary case of conviction. Post, at 20–32. But
normally courts do not rescue parties from their conces­
sions, maybe least of all concessions from a party as able

   While sometimes we may or even must forgo the adver­
sarial process, I do not see the case for doing so today.
Maybe especially because I am not sure JUSTICE THOMAS’s
is the only available alternative reading of the statute we
would have to consider, even if we did reject the govern­
ment’s concession and wipe the precedential slate clean.
We might also have to consider an interpretation that
would have courts ask not whether the alien’s crime of
conviction ordinarily involves a risk of physical force, or
whether the defendant’s particular crime involved such a
risk, but whether the defendant’s crime of conviction
always does so. After all, the language before us requires
a conviction for an “offense . . . that, by its nature, involves
a substantial risk of physical force.” 1</pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">8</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §16(b)
(emphasis added). Plausibly, anyway, the word “nature”
might refer to an inevitable characteristic of the offense;
one that would present itself automatically, whenever the
statute is violated. See 10 Oxford English Dictionary 247
(2d ed. 1989). While I remain open to different arguments
about our precedent and the proper reading of language
like this, I would address them in another case, whether
involving the INA or a different statute, where the parties
have a chance to be heard and we might benefit from their
learning.
   It’s important to note the narrowness of our decision
today in another respect too. Vagueness doctrine repre­
sents a procedural, not a substantive, demand. It does not
forbid the legislature from acting toward any end it wishes,
but only requires it to act with enough clarity that
reasonable people can know what is required of them and
judges can apply the law consistent with their limited
office. Our history surely bears examples of the judicial
misuse of the so-called “substantive component” of due

process to dictate policy on matters that belonged to the
people to decide. But concerns with substantive due pro­
cess should not lead us to react by withdrawing an ancient
procedural protection compelled by the original meaning of
the Constitution.
   Today’s decision sweeps narrowly in yet one more way.
By any fair estimate, Congress has largely satisfied the
procedural demand of fair notice even in the INA provision
before us. The statute lists a number of specific crimes
that can lead to a lawful resident’s removal—for example,
murder, rape, and sexual abuse of a minor. </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">8</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">.
§1101(a)(43)(A). Our ruling today does not touch this list.
We address only the statute’s “residual clause” where
Congress ended its own list and asked us to begin writing
our own. Just as Blackstone’s legislature passed a revised
statute clarifying that “cattle” covers bulls and oxen,
Congress remains free at any time to add more crimes to
its list. It remains free, as well, to write a new residual
clause that affords the fair notice lacking here. Congress
might, for example, say that a conviction for any felony
carrying a prison sentence of a specified length opens an
alien to removal. Congress has done almost exactly this in
other laws. See, e.g., 1</pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">8</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §922(g). What was done
there could be done here.
   But those laws are not this law. And while the statute
before us doesn’t rise to the level of threatening death for
“pretended offences” of treason, no one should be surprised
that the Constitution looks unkindly on any law so vague
that reasonable people cannot understand its terms and
judges do not know where to begin in applying it. A gov­
ernment of laws and not of men can never tolerate that
arbitrary power. And, in my judgment, that foundational
principle dictates today’s result. Because I understand
them to be consistent with what I have said here, I join
Parts I, III, IV–B, and V of the Court’s opinion and concur
in the judgment.

  In Johnson v. United States, we concluded that the
residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act was
unconstitutionally vague, given the “indeterminacy of the

(2015) (slip op., at 5). Today, the Court relies wholly on
Johnson—but only some of Johnson—to strike down an-
other provision, 1</pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">8</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §16(b). Because §16(b) does
not give rise to the concerns that drove the Court’s deci-
sion in Johnson, I respectfully dissent.
                           I
  The term “crime of violence” appears repeatedly
throughout the Federal Criminal Code. Section 16 of Title
18 defines it to mean:
    “(a) an offense that has as an element the use, at-
    tempted use, or threatened use of physical force
    against the person or property of another, or
    “(b) any other offense that is a felony and that, by its
    nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force
    against the person or property of another may be used
    in the course of committing the offense.”
This definition of “crime of violence” is also incorporated in
2                   SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

the definition of “aggravated felony” in the Immigration
and Nationality Act. </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">8</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §1101(a)(43)(F) (“aggra-
vated felony” includes “a crime of violence (as defined in
section 16 of title 18, but not including a purely political
offense) for which the term of imprisonment [is] at least
one year” (footnote omitted)). A conviction for an aggra-
vated felony carries serious consequences under the immi-
gration laws. It can serve as the basis for an alien’s re-
moval from the United States, and can preclude
cancellation of removal by the Attorney General.
§§1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), 1229b(a)(3).
  Those consequences came to pass in respondent James
Dimaya’s case. An Immigration Judge and the Board of
Immigration Appeals interpreted §16(b) to cover Dimaya’s
two prior convictions for first-degree residential burglary
under California law, subjecting him to removal. To stave
off that result, Dimaya argued that the language of §16(b)
was void for vagueness under the Due Process Clause of
the Fifth Amendment.
  The parties begin by disputing whether a criminal or
more relaxed civil vagueness standard should apply in
resolving Dimaya’s challenge. A plurality of the Court
rejects the Government’s argument in favor of a civil
standard, because of the “grave nature of deportation,”

at 6 (plurality opinion); JUSTICE GORSUCH does so for
broader reasons, see ante, at 10–15 (GORSUCH, J., concur-
ring in part and concurring in judgment). I see no need to
resolve which standard applies, because I would hold that
§16(b) is not unconstitutionally vague even under the
standard applicable to criminal laws.

gory of state crimes, specifically DUI offenses involving no
more than negligent conduct. 543 U. S., at 6. Far from
finding §16(b) “hopeless[ly] indetermina[te],” Johnson, 576
U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7), we considered the provision
clear and unremarkable: “while §16(b) is broader than
§16(a) in the sense that physical force need not actually be
applied,” the provision “simply covers offenses that natu-
rally involve a person acting in disregard of the risk that
physical force might be used against another in commit-
ting an offense,” Leocal, 543 U. S., at 10–11. Applying
that standard to the state offense at issue, we concluded—
unanimously—that §16(b) “cannot be read to include [a]
conviction for DUI causing serious bodily injury under
Florida law.” Id., at 11.
   Leocal thus provides a model for how courts should
assess whether a particular crime “by its nature” involves
a risk of the use of physical force. At the outset, our opin-
ion set forth the elements of the Florida DUI statute,
which made it a felony “for a person to operate a vehicle
while under the influence and, ‘by reason of such opera-
tion, caus[e] . . . [s]erious bodily injury to another.’ ” 543
U. S., at 7. Our §16(b) analysis, in turn, focused on those
specific elements in concluding that a Florida offender’s
acts would not naturally give rise to the requisite risk of
force “in the course of committing the offense.” Id., at 11.
“In no ‘ordinary or natural’ sense,” we explained, “can it be
said that a person risks having to ‘use’ physical force
against another person in the course of operating a vehicle
while intoxicated and causing injury.” Ibid.
   The Court holds that the same provision we had no
trouble applying in Leocal is in fact incapable of reasoned
application. The sole justification for this turnabout is the
resemblance between the language of §16(b) and the lan-
guage of the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal
Act (ACCA) that was at issue in Johnson. The latter
provision defined a “violent felony” to include “any crime
4                    SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one
year . . . that . . . is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves
use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that pre­
sents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.”
1</pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">8</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (emphasis added).
   In Johnson, we concluded that the ACCA residual
clause (the “or otherwise” language) gave rise to two forms
of intractable uncertainty, which “conspire[d]” to render
the provision unconstitutionally vague. 576 U. S., at ___
(slip op., at 5). First, the residual clause asked courts to
gauge the “potential risk” of “physical injury” posed by the
conduct involved in the crime. Ibid. That inquiry, we
determined, entailed not only an evaluation of the “crimi-
nal’s behavior,” but also required courts to consider “how
the idealized ordinary case of the crime subsequently
plays out.” Ibid. Second, the residual clause obligated
courts to compare that risk to an indeterminate stand-
ard—one that was inextricably linked to the provision’s
four enumerated crimes, which presented differing kinds
and degrees of risk. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6). This murky
confluence of features, each of which “may [have been]
tolerable in isolation,” together “ma[de] a task for us
which at best could be only guesswork.” Id., at ___ (slip
op., at 10).
   Section 16(b) does not present the same ambiguities.
The two provisions do correspond to some extent. Under
our decisions, both ask the sentencing court to consider
whether a particular offense, defined without regard to the
facts of the conviction, poses a specified risk. And, rele-
vant to both statutes, we have explained that in deciding
whether statutory elements inherently produce a risk, a
court must take into account how those elements will
ordinarily be fulfilled. See James v. United States, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""145743""><a href=""/opinion/145743/james-v-united-states/""><span class=""volume"">550</span>

offense, in the ordinary case, presents” the requisite risk).1
In the Court’s view, that effectively resolves this case. But
the Court too readily dismisses the significant textual
distinctions between §16(b) and the ACCA residual clause.
See also ante, at 2 (opinion of GORSUCH, J.). Those differ-
ences undermine the conclusion that §16(b) shares each
of the “dual flaws” of that clause. Ante, at 21 (majority
opinion).
  To begin, §16(b) yields far less uncertainty “about how
to estimate the risk posed by a crime.” Johnson, 576 U. S.,
at ___ (slip op., at 5). There are three material differences
between §16(b) and the ACCA residual clause in this
respect. First, the ACCA clause directed the reader to
consider whether the offender’s conduct presented a “po­
tential risk” of injury. Forced to give meaning to that
befuddling choice of phrase—which layered one indeter-
minate term on top of another—we understood the word
“potential” to signify that “Congress intended to encom-
pass possibilities even more contingent or remote than “a
simple ‘risk.’ ” James, 550 U. S., at 207–208. As we ex-
plained in Johnson, that made for a “speculative” inquiry
“detached from statutory elements.” 576 U. S., at ___ (slip
op., at 5). In other words, the offense elements could not
constrain the risk inquiry in the manner they do here. See
——————
  1 All this “ordinary case” caveat means is that while “[o]ne can always

hypothesize unusual cases in which even a prototypically violent crime
might not present a genuine risk,” courts should exclude those atypical
cases in assessing whether the offense qualifies. James, 550 U. S., at
208. As we have explained, under that approach, it is not the case that
“every conceivable factual offense covered by a statute” must pose the
requisite risk “before the offense can be deemed” a crime of violence.
Ibid. But the same is true of the categorical approach generally. See
ibid. (using the terms just quoted to characterize both the ordinary case
approach and the categorical approach for enumerated offenses set
forth in Taylor v. United States, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""112435""><a href=""/opinion/112435/taylor-v-united-states/""><span class=""volume"">495</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">575</span></a></span><pre class=""inline""> (1990)); Moncrieffe v.

                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

Leocal, 543 U. S., at 11. The “serious potential risk”
standard also forced courts to assess in an expansive way
the “collateral consequences” of the perpetrator’s acts. For
example, courts had to take into account the concern that
others might cause injury in attempting to apprehend the
offender. See Sykes v. United States, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""218457""><a href=""/opinion/218457/sykes-v-united-states/""><span class=""volume"">564</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">1</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 8–9
(2011). Section 16(b), on the other hand, asks about “risk”
alone, a familiar concept of everyday life. It therefore calls
for a commonsense inquiry that does not compel a court to
venture beyond the offense elements to consider contin-
gent and remote possibilities.
   Second, §16(b) focuses exclusively on the risk that the
offender will “use[ ]” “physical force” “against” another
person or another person’s property. Thus, unlike the
ACCA residual clause, “§16(b) plainly does not encompass
all offenses which create a ‘substantial risk’ that injury
will result from a person’s conduct.” Leocal, 543 U. S., at
10, n. 7 (emphasis added). The point is not that an inquiry
into the risk of “physical force” is markedly more determi-
nate than an inquiry into the risk of “physical injury.” But
see ante, at 19–20. The difference is that §16(b) asks
about the risk that the offender himself will actively em­
ploy force against person or property. That language does
not sweep in all instances in which the offender’s acts, or
another person’s reaction, might result in unintended or
negligent harm.
   Third, §16(b) has a temporal limit that the ACCA resid-
ual clause lacked: The “substantial risk” of force must
arise “in the course of committing the offense.” Properly
interpreted, this means the statute requires a substantial
risk that the perpetrator will use force while carrying out
the crime. See Leocal, 543 U. S., at 10 (“The reckless
disregard in §16 relates . . . to the risk that the use of
physical force against another might be required in com-
mitting a crime.”). The provision thereby excludes more
attenuated harms that might arise following the comple-
                 Cite as: </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">584</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">____ (2018)           7

                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

tion of the crime. The ACCA residual clause, by contrast,
contained no similar language restricting its scope. And
the absence of such a limit, coupled with the reference to
“potential” risks, gave courts free rein to classify an of-
fense as a violent felony based on injuries that might occur
after the offense was over and done. See, e.g., United
States v. Benton, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">639</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.3d</span> <span class=""page"">723</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 732 (CA6 2011) (finding
that “solicitation to commit aggravated assault” qualified
under the ACCA residual clause on the theory that the
solicited individual might subsequently carry out the
requested act).
   Why does any of this matter? Because it mattered in
Johnson. More precisely, the expansive language in the
ACCA residual clause contributed to our determination
that the clause gave rise to “grave uncertainty about how
to estimate the risk posed by a crime.” 576 U. S., at ___
(slip op., at 5). “Critically,” we said—a word that tends to
mean something—“picturing the criminal’s behavior is not
enough.” Ibid. (emphasis added). Instead, measuring
“potential risk” “seemingly require[d] the judge to imagine
how the idealized ordinary case of the crime subsequently
plays out.” Ibid. (emphasis added). Not so here. In apply-
ing §16(b), considering “the criminal’s behavior” is enough.
   Those three distinctions—the unadorned reference to
“risk,” the focus on the offender’s own active employment
of force, and the “in the course of committing” limitation—
also mean that many hard cases under ACCA are easier
under §16(b). Take the firearm possession crime from
Johnson itself, which had as its constituent elements
(1) unlawfully (2) possessing (3) a short-barreled shotgun.
None of those elements, “by its nature,” carries “a sub-
stantial risk” that the possessor will use force against
another “in the course of committing the offense.” Nothing
inherent in the act of firearm possession, even when it is
unlawful, gives rise to a substantial risk that the owner
will then shoot someone. See United States v. Serafin, 562
8                         SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                         ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

F. 3d 1105, 1113 (CA10 2009) (recognizing that “Leocal
instructs [a court] to focus not on whether possession will
likely result in violence, but instead whether one pos-
sessing an unregistered weapon necessarily risks the need
to employ force to commit possession”).2 Yet short-
barreled shotgun possession presented a closer question
under the ACCA residual clause, because the “serious
potential risk” language seemingly directed us to consider
“the circumstances and conduct that ordinarily attend the
offense,” in addition to the offense itself. Johnson, 576
U. S., at ___ (ALITO, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 17); see id.,
at ___–___ (slip op., at 19–20) (reasoning that the crime
must qualify because “a person who chooses to break the
law and risk the heavy criminal penalty incurred by pos-
sessing a notoriously dangerous weapon is [likely] to use
that weapon in violent ways”).

crime “whose treatment becomes more obvious under
§16(b) than under ACCA,” ante, at 18. In Chambers, the
——————
    2 TheCourt protests that this straightforward analysis fails to take
account of the crime’s ordinary case. Ante, at 18–19, n. 6. But the fact
that the element of “possession” may “take[ ] place in a variety of
ways”—for instance, one may possess a firearm “in a closet, in a store-
room, in a car, in a pocket,” “unloaded, disassembled, or locked away,”
Johnson, 576 U. S., at ___ (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (slip
op., at 4)—matters very little. That is because none of the alternative
ways of satisfying that element produce a substantial risk that the
possessor will use physical force against the person or property of
another. And no one would say that a person “possesses” a gun by
firing it or threatening someone with it. Cf. id., at ___ (opinion of
THOMAS, J.) (slip op., at 5) (“[T]he risk that the Government identifies
arises not from the act of possessing the weapon, but from the act of
using it.”). The Court’s insistence that this offense is nonetheless
“difficult to classify” under §16(b), ante, at 18, n. 6, is surprising in light
of our assessment, just two Terms ago, that §16 does not cover “felon-
in-possession laws and other firearms offenses,” Luna Torres v. Lynch,

                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

Government argued that the requisite risk of injury arises
not necessarily at the time the offender fails to report to
prison, but instead later, when an officer attempts to
recapture the fugitive. 555 U. S., at 128. The majority is
correct that we ultimately “reject[ed]” the Government’s
contention. Ante, at 18. But we did so after “assum[ing]
for argument’s sake” its premise—that is, “the relevance of
violence that may occur long after an offender fails to
report.” 555 U. S., at 128; see id., at 129 (looking at 160
cases of “failure to report” and observing that “none at all
involved violence . . . during the commission of the offense
itself, [nor] during the offender’s later apprehension”).
The “in the course of committing the offense” language in
§16(b) helpfully forecloses that debate.
   DUI offenses are yet another example. Because §16(b)
asks about the risk that the offender will “use[ ]” “physical
force,” we readily concluded in Leocal that the subsection
does not cover offenses where the danger arises from the
offender’s negligent or accidental conduct, including drunk
driving. 543 U. S., at 11. Applying the ACCA residual
clause proved more trying. When asked to decide whether
the clause covered drunk driving offenses, a majority of
the Court concluded that the answer was no. Begay v.
United States, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""145815""><a href=""/opinion/145815/begay-v-united-states/""><span class=""volume"">553</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">137</span></a></span><pre class=""inline""> (2008). Our decision was
based, however, on the inference that the clause must
cover only “purposeful, ‘violent,’ and ‘aggressive’ con-
duct”—a test derived not from the “conduct that presents a
serious potential risk of physical injury” language, but
instead by reference to (what we guessed to be) the unify-
ing characteristics of the enumerated offenses. Id., at
144–145. Four Members of the Court criticized that test,
see id., at 150–153 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment);
id., at 158–160, 162–163 (ALITO, J., dissenting), though
they themselves disagreed about whether DUIs were
covered, see id., at 153–154 (opinion of Scalia, J.); id., at
156–158 (opinion of ALITO, J.). And the Court distanced
10                  SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

itself from the Begay requirement only a few years later
when confronting the crime of vehicular flight. See Sykes,
564 U. S., at 12–13; Johnson, 576 U. S., at ___–___ (slip
op., at 8–9).
   Which brings me to the second part of the Court’s analy-
sis: its objection that §16(b), like the ACCA residual
clause, leaves “uncertainty about the level of risk that
makes a crime ‘violent.’ ” Ante, at 10. The “substantial
risk” standard in §16(b) is significantly less confusing
because it is not tied to a disjointed list of paradigm of-
fenses. Recall that the ACCA provision defined a “violent
felony” to include a crime that “is burglary, arson, or
extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves
conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical
injury to another.” 1</pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">8</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (emphasis
added). As our Court recognized early on, that “otherwise”
told the reader to understand the “serious potential risk of
physical injury” standard by way of the four enumerated
crimes. James, 550 U. S., at 203. But how, exactly? That
question dogged our residual clause cases for years, until
we said no más in Johnson.
   In our first foray, James, we resolved the case by asking
whether the risk posed by the crime of attempted burglary
was “comparable to that posed by its closest analog among
the enumerated offenses,” which was completed burglary.
550 U. S., at 203. While that rule “[took] care of attempted
burglary,” it “offer[ed] no help at all with respect to the
vast majority of offenses, which have no apparent analog
among the enumerated crimes.” Johnson, 576 U. S., at ___
(slip op., at 7). The James dissent, for its part, would have
determined the requisite degree of risk from the least
dangerous of the enumerated crimes, and compared the
offense to that. 550 U. S., at 218–219 (opinion of Scalia,
J.). But that approach also proved to be harder than it
sounded. See id., at 219–227.
   After James came Begay, in which we concluded that

                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

the enumerated offenses served as an independent limita-
tion on the kind of crime that could qualify. 553 U. S., at
142; see Chambers, 555 U. S., at 128 (applying the Begay
standard). As discussed, that test was short lived (though
we did not purport to wholly repudiate it). See Sykes, 564
U. S., at 13. Finally, in Sykes—our penultimate residual
clause case—we acknowledged the prior use of the closest-
analog test in James, but instead focused on whether the
risk posed by vehicular flight was “similar in degree of
danger” to the listed offenses of arson and burglary. 564
U. S., at 8–10. As a result, Justice Scalia’s dissent charac-
terized the Sykes majority as applying the test from his
prior dissent in James, not James itself. See 564 U. S., at
29–30, 33. This series of precedents laid bare our “repeated
inability to craft a principled test out of the statutory
text,” id., at 34 (opinion of Scalia, J.), as the Court ulti-
mately acknowledged in Johnson, 576 U. S., at ___ (slip
op., at 7).
   The enumerated offenses, and our Court’s failed at-
tempts to make sense of them, were essential to Johnson’s
conclusion that the residual clause “leaves uncertainty
about how much risk it takes for a crime to qualify as a
violent felony.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6). As Johnson
explained, the issue was not that the statute employed a
fuzzy standard. That kind of thing appears in the statute
books all the time. Id., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 6, 12). In
the majority’s retelling today, the difficulty inhered solely
in the fact that the statute paired such a standard with
the ordinary case inquiry. See ante, at 8, 10–11, 21. But
that account sidesteps much of Johnson’s reasoning. See
576 U. S., at ___–___, ___, ___–___, ___ (slip op., at 4–5, 6,
7–9, 12). Our opinion emphasized that the word “other-
wise” “force[d]” courts to interpret the amorphous stand-
ard “in light of ” the four enumerated crimes, which are
“not much more similar to one another in kind than in
degree of risk posed.” Id., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 6, 8). Or,
12                       SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                        ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

as Johnson put it more vividly, “[t]he phrase ‘shades of
red,’ standing alone, does not generate confusion or un-
predictability; but the phrase ‘fire-engine red, light pink,
maroon, navy blue, or colors that otherwise involve shades
of red’ assuredly does so.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 12).
Indeed, the author of Johnson had previously, and repeat-
edly, described this feature of the residual clause as the
“crucial . . . respect” in which the law was problematic.
See James, 550 U. S., at 230, n. 7 (opinion of Scalia, J.);
Sykes, 564 U. S., at 35 (opinion of Scalia, J.).
   With §16(b), by contrast, a court need simply consider
the meaning of the word “substantial”—a word our Court
has interpreted and applied innumerable times across a
wide variety of contexts.3 The court does not need to give
that familiar word content by reference to four different
offenses with varying amounts and kinds of risk.
   In its effort to recast a considerable portion of Johnson
as dicta, the majority speculates that if the enumerated
offenses had truly mattered to the outcome, the Court
would have told lower courts to “give up on trying to inter-
pret the clause by reference to” those offenses, rather than
striking down the provision entirely. Ante, at 21. No
litigant in Johnson suggested that solution, which is not
surprising. Such judicial redrafting could have expanded
the reach of the criminal provision—surely a job for Con-

gress alone.
  In any event, I doubt the majority’s proposal would have
done the trick. And that is because the result in Johnson
did not follow from the presence of one frustrating textual
feature or another. Quite the opposite: The decision em-
phasized that it was the “sum” of the “uncertainties” in the
ACCA residual clause, confirmed by years of experience,
that “convince[d]” us the provision was beyond salvage.
Johnson, 576 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10). Those failings
do not characterize the provision at issue here.
                           III
  The more constrained inquiry required under §16(b)—
which asks only whether the offense elements naturally
carry with them a risk that the offender will use force in
committing the offense—does not itself engender “grave
uncertainty about how to estimate the risk posed by a
crime.” And the provision’s use of a commonplace sub-
stantial risk standard—one not tied to a list of crimes that
lack a unifying feature—does not give rise to intolerable
“uncertainty about how much risk it takes for a crime to
qualify.” That should be enough to reject Dimaya’s facial
vagueness challenge.4

   4 The Court also finds it probative that “a host of issues” respecting

§16(b) “divide” the lower courts. Ante, at 22. Yet the Court does little
to explain how those alleged conflicts vindicate its particular concern
about the provision (namely, the ordinary case inquiry). And as the
Government illustrates, many of those divergent results likely can be
chalked up to material differences in the state offense statutes at issue.

§16(b), the Court reproaches me for not giving sufficient
weight to a “core insight” of Johnson. Ante, at 10, n. 4; see
ante, at 15 (opinion of GORSUCH, J.) (arguing that §16(b)
runs afoul of Johnson “to the extent [§16(b)] requires an
‘ordinary case’ analysis”). But the fact that the ACCA
residual clause required the ordinary case approach was
not itself sufficient to doom the law. We instead took
pains to clarify that our opinion should not be read to
impart such an absolute rule. See Johnson, 576 U. S., at
___ (slip op., at 10). I would adhere to that careful holding
and not reflexively extend the decision to a different stat-
ute whose reach is, on the whole, far more clear.
   The Court does the opposite, and the ramifications of
that decision are significant. First, of course, today’s
holding invalidates a provision of the Immigration and
Nationality Act—part of the definition of “aggravated
felony”—on which the Government relies to “ensure that
dangerous criminal aliens are removed from the United
States.” Brief for United States 54. Contrary to the
Court’s back-of-the-envelope assessment, see ante, at 23,
n. 12, the Government explains that the definition is
“critical” for “numerous” immigration provisions. Brief for
United States 12.
   In addition, §16 serves as the universal definition of
“crime of violence” for all of Title 18 of the United States
Code. Its language is incorporated into many procedural
and substantive provisions of criminal law, including
provisions concerning racketeering, money laundering,
domestic violence, using a child to commit a violent crime,
and distributing information about the making or use of
explosives. See 1</pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">8</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §§25(a)(1), 842(p)(2), 1952(a),
1956(c)(7)(B)(ii), 1959(a)(4), 2261(a), 3561(b). Of special
concern, §16 is replicated in the definition of “crime of
violence” applicable to §924(c), which prohibits using or
carrying a firearm “during and in relation to any crime of
violence,” or possessing a firearm “in furtherance of any

such crime.” §§924(c)(1)(A), (c)(3). Though I express no
view on whether §924(c) can be distinguished from the
provision we consider here, the Court’s holding calls into
question convictions under what the Government warns
us is an “oft-prosecuted offense.”     Brief for United
States 12.
  Because Johnson does not compel today’s result, I
respectfully dissent.

                         [April 17, 2018] 


   JUSTICE THOMAS, with whom JUSTICE KENNEDY and
JUSTICE ALITO join as to Parts I–C–2, II–A–1, and II–B,
dissenting.
   I agree with THE CHIEF JUSTICE that 1</pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">8</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §16(b),
as incorporated by the Immigration and Nationality Act
(INA), is not unconstitutionally vague. Section 16(b) lacks
many of the features that caused this Court to invalidate
the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act
(ACCA) in Johnson v. United States, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">576</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">___ (2015).
ACCA’s residual clause—a provision that this Court had
applied four times before Johnson—was not unconstitu­
tionally vague either. See id., at ___ (THOMAS, J., concur­
ring in judgment) (slip op., at 1); id., at ___–___ (ALITO, J.,
dissenting) (slip op., at 13–17). But if the Court insists on
adhering to Johnson, it should at least take Johnson at its
word that the residual clause was vague due to the “ ‘sum’ ”
of its specific features. Id., at ___ (majority opinion) (slip
op., at 10). By ignoring this limitation, the Court jettisons
Johnson’s assurance that its holding would not jeopardize
“dozens of federal and state criminal laws.” Id., at ___
(slip op., at 12).
   While THE CHIEF JUSTICE persuasively explains why
respondent cannot prevail under our precedents, I write
separately to make two additional points. First, I continue
to doubt that our practice of striking down statutes as
2                   SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                    THOMAS, J., dissenting

unconstitutionally vague is consistent with the original
meaning of the Due Process Clause. See id., at ___–___
(opinion of THOMAS, J.) (slip op., at 7–18). Second, if the
Court thinks that §16(b) is unconstitutionally vague be­
cause of the “categorical approach,” see ante, at 6–11, then
the Court should abandon that approach—not insist on
reading it into statutes and then strike them down. Ac­
cordingly, I respectfully dissent.
                              I
   I continue to harbor doubts about whether the vague­
ness doctrine can be squared with the original meaning of
the Due Process Clause—and those doubts are only ampli­
fied in the removal context. I am also skeptical that the
vagueness doctrine can be justified as a way to prevent
delegations of core legislative power in this context. But I
need not resolve these questions because, if the vagueness
doctrine has any basis in the Due Process Clause, it must
be limited to cases in which the statute is unconstitution­
ally vague as applied to the person challenging it. That is
not the case for respondent, whose prior convictions for
first-degree residential burglary in California fall comfort­
ably within the scope of §16(b).
                              A
   The Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause provides
that no person shall be “deprived of life, liberty, or prop-
erty, without due process of law.” Section 16(b), as incorpo­
rated by the INA, cannot violate this Clause unless the
following propositions are true: The Due Process Clause
requires federal statutes to provide certain minimal pro­
cedures, the vagueness doctrine is one of those procedures,
and the vagueness doctrine applies to statutes governing
the removal of aliens. Although I need not resolve any of
these propositions today, each one is questionable. I will
address them in turn.

                                1

   First, the vagueness doctrine is not legitimate unless
the “law of the land” view of due process is incorrect.
Under that view, due process “require[s] only that our
Government . . . proceed . . . according to written constitu­
tional and statutory provision[s] before depriving someone
of life, liberty, or property.” Nelson v. Colorado, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">581</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span>
<span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">___, ___, n. 1 (2017) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 2,
n. 1) (internal quotation marks omitted). More than a half
century after the founding, the Court rejected this view of
due process in Murray’s Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Im-
provement Co., </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""87010""><a href=""/opinion/87010/murrays-lessee-v-hoboken-land-improvement-co/""><span class=""volume"">18</span> <span class=""reporter"">How.</span> <span class=""page"">272</span></a></span><pre class=""inline""> (1856). See id., at 276 (hold­
ing that the Due Process Clause “is a restraint on the
legislative as well as on the executive and judicial powers
of the government”). But the textual and historical sup­
port for the law-of-the-land view is not insubstantial.1
                             2
  Even under Murray’s Lessee, the vagueness doctrine is
legitimate only if it is a “settled usag[e] and mod[e] of
proceeding existing in the common and statute law of
England, before the emigration of our ancestors.” Id., at
277. That proposition is dubious. Until the end of the
19th century, “there is little indication that anyone . . .
believed that courts had the power under the Due Process
Claus[e] to nullify statutes on [vagueness] ground[s].”

vague laws. Rather, early American courts, like their
English predecessors, addressed vague laws through
statutory construction instead of constitutional law. See

   The difference between the traditional rule of lenity and


——————
   2 Before the 19th century, when virtually all felonies were punishable

by death, English courts would sometimes go to extremes to find a
reason to invoke the rule of lenity. See Hall, Strict or Liberal Construc­
tion of Penal Statutes, 48 Harv. L. Rev. 748, 751 (1935); e.g., ante, at 4–
7 (GORSUCH, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (citing
Blackstone’s discussion of a case about “cattle”). As the death penalty
became less common, courts on this side of the Atlantic tempered the
rule of lenity, clarifying that the rule requires an “ambiguity” in the
text and cannot be used “to defeat the obvious intention of the legisla­
ture.” United States v. Wiltberger, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">5</span> <span class=""reporter"">Wheat.</span> <span class=""page"">76</span></span><pre class=""inline""> (1820) (Marshall, C. J.).
   Early American courts also declined to apply nonpenal statutes that
were “unintelligible.” Johnson v. United States, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">576</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">___, ___, n. 3
(2014) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 10, n. 3); e.g.,
ante, at 5–6, and n. 1 (opinion of GORSUCH, J.) (collecting cases). Like
lenity, however, this practice reflected a principle of statutory construc­
tion that was much narrower than the modern constitutional vagueness
doctrine. Unintelligible statutes were considered inoperative because
they were impossible to apply to individual cases, not because they
were unconstitutional for failing to provide “fair notice.” See Johnson,
576 U. S., at ___, n. 3 (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (slip op., at 10, n. 3).

the modern vagueness doctrine is not merely semantic.
Most obviously, lenity is a tool of statutory construction,
which means States can abrogate it—and many have.
Hall, Strict or Liberal Construction of Penal Statutes, 48
Harv. L. Rev. 748, 752–754 (1935); see also Scalia, Assorted
Canards of Contemporary Legal Analysis, 40 Case W.
Res. L. Rev. 581, 583 (1989) (“Arizona, by the way, seems
to have preserved a fair and free society without adopting
the rule that criminal statutes are to be strictly construed”
(citing Ariz. Rev. Stat. §1-211C (1989))). The vagueness
doctrine, by contrast, is a rule of constitutional law that
States cannot alter or abolish. Lenity, moreover, applies
only to “penal” statutes, 1 Blackstone, Commentaries on
the Laws of England 88 (1765), but the vagueness doctrine
extends to all regulations of individual conduct, both penal
and nonpenal, Johnson, 576 U. S., at ___ (opinion of
THOMAS, J.) (slip op., at 6); see also Note, Indefinite Crite­
ria of Definiteness in Statutes, 45 Harv. L. Rev. 160, 163
(1931) (explaining that the modern vagueness doctrine
was not merely an “extension of the rule of strict construc­
tion of penal statutes” because it “expressly include[s] civil
statutes within its scope,” reflecting a “regrettable disre­
gard” for legislatures).3 In short, early American courts
were not applying the modern vagueness doctrine by
another name. They were engaged in a fundamentally
different enterprise.
    Tellingly, the modern vagueness doctrine emerged at a
time when this Court was actively interpreting the Due

  3 This distinction between penal and nonpenal statutes would be

decisive here because, traditionally, civil deportation laws were not
considered penal. See Bugajewitz v. Adams, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""97876""><a href=""/opinion/97876/bugajewitz-v-adams/""><span class=""volume"">228</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">585</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 591 (1913);

That the vagueness doctrine “develop[ed] on the federal
level concurrently with the growth of the tool of substan­
tive due process” does not seem like a coincidence. Note,
</pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">23</span> <span class=""reporter"">Ind.</span> <span class=""page"">L</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. J., at 278. Like substantive due process, the

This Court, for example, has used the vagueness doctrine
to invalidate antiloitering laws, even though those laws
predate the Declaration of Independence. See Johnson,

   This Court also has a bad habit of invoking the Due
Process Clause to constitutionalize rules that were tradi­

of this practice, then that is all the more reason to doubt
its legitimacy.

Due Process Clause governed the removal of aliens was
not announced until the 20th century.
   Less than a decade after the ratification of the Bill of
Rights, the founding generation had an extensive debate
about the relationship between the Constitution and
federal removal statutes. In 1798, the Fifth Congress
enacted the Alien Acts. One of those Acts, the Alien
Friends Act, gave the President unfettered discretion to
expel any aliens “he shall judge dangerous to the peace
and safety of the United States, or shall have reasonable
grounds to suspect are concerned in any treasonable or
secret machinations against the government thereof.” An
Act Concerning Aliens §1, 1 Stat. 571. This statute was
modeled after the Aliens Act 1793 in England, which
similarly gave the King unfettered discretion to expel
aliens as he “shall think necessary for the publick Secur­
ity.” 33 Geo. III, ch. 4, §18, in 39 Eng. Stat. at Large 16.
Both the Fifth Congress and the States thoroughly de-
bated the Alien Friends Act. Virginia and Kentucky enacted
resolutions (anonymously drafted by Madison and Jeffer­
son) opposing the Act, while 10 States enacted counter-
resolutions condemning the views of Virginia and Ken­
tucky. See Fehlings, Storm on the Constitution: The First
Deportation Law, 10 Tulsa J. Comp. & Int’l L. 63, 85, 103
(2002).

the Alien Friends Act as a threat to their party and the
institution of slavery,4 raised a number of constitutional

objections. Some of the Jeffersonians argued that the
Alien Friends Act violated the Fifth Amendment’s Due
Process Clause. They complained that the Act failed to
provide aliens with all the accouterments of a criminal
trial. See, e.g., Kentucky Resolutions ¶6, in 4 The Debates
in the Several Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal
Constitution 541–542 (J. Elliot ed. 1836) (Elliot’s Debates);
8 Annals of Cong. 1982–1983 (1798) (statement of Rep.
Gallatin); Madison’s Report on the Virginia Resolutions
(Jan. 7, 1800), in 6 Writings of James Madison 361–362
(G. Hunt ed. 1906) (Madison’s Report).5
   The Federalists gave two primary responses to this due
process argument. First, the Federalists argued that the
rights of aliens were governed by the law of nations, not
the Constitution. See, e.g., Randolph, Debate on Virginia
Resolutions, in The Virginia Report of 1799–1800, pp. 34–
35 (1850) (Virginia Debates) (statement of George K.
Taylor) (arguing that aliens “were not a party to the [Con­
stitution]” and that “cases between the government and

——————
political strength came from the South. See Fehlings, Storm on the
Constitution: The First Deportation Law, 10 Tulsa J. Comp. & Int’l L.
63, 84 (2002). The Jeffersonians opposed any federal control over
immigration, which their constituents feared would be used to pre-empt
State laws that prohibited the entry of free blacks. Id., at 84–85; see
also Berns, Freedom of the Press and the Alien and Sedition Laws: A
Reappraisal, 1970 S. Ct. Rev. 109, 116 (“Whether pro- or anti-slavery,
most southerners, including Jefferson and Madison . . . were united
behind a policy of denying to the national government any competence
to deal with the question of slavery”). The fear was that “mobile free
Negroes would intermingle with slaves, encourage them to run away,
and foment insurrection.” I. Berlin, Slaves Without Masters 92 (1974).
  5 The Jeffersonians also argued that the Alien Friends Act violated

due process because, if aliens disobeyed the President’s orders to leave
the country, they could be convicted of a crime and imprisoned without
a trial. See, e.g., Kentucky Resolutions ¶6, 4 Elliot’s Debates 541. That
charge was false. The Alien Friends Act gave federal courts jurisdiction
over alleged violations of the President’s orders. See §4, 1 Stat. 571.

(statement of William Cowan) (identifying the source of
rights “as to citizens, the Constitution; as to aliens, the
law of nations”); A. Addison, A Charge to the Grand Juries
of the County Courts of the Fifth Circuit of the State of
Pennsylvania 18 (1799) (Charge to the Grand Juries)
(“[T]he Constitution leaves aliens, as in other countries, to
the protection of the general principles of the law of na­
tions”); Answer to the Resolutions of the State of Ken­
tucky, Oct. 29, 1799, in 4 Records of the Governor and
Council of the State of Vermont 528 (1876) (denying “that
aliens had any rights among us, except what they derived
from the law of nations, and rights of hospitality”). The
law of nations imposed no enforceable limits on a nation’s
power to remove aliens. See, e.g., 1 E. de Vattel, Law of
Nations, §§230–231, pp. 108–109 (J. Chitty et al. transl.
and ed. 1883).
   Second, the Federalists responded that the expulsion of
aliens “did not touch life, liberty, or property.” Virginia
Debates 34. The founding generation understood the
phrase “life, liberty, or property” to refer to a relatively
narrow set of core private rights that did not depend on
the will of the government. See Wellness Int’l Network,

(2007) (Nelson).      Quasi-private rights—“privileges” or
“franchises” bestowed by the government on individuals—
did not qualify and could be taken away without judicial
process. See B&B Hardware, Inc. v. Hargis Industries,

(slip op., at 12); Nelson 567–569. The Federalists argued
that an alien’s right to reside in this country was one such
privilege. See, e.g., Virginia Debates 34 (arguing that
“ordering away an alien . . . was not a matter of right, but
of favour,” which did not require a jury trial); Report of the

Select Committee of the House of Representatives, Made
to the House of Representatives on Feb. 21, 1799, 9 Annals
of Cong. 2987 (1799) (stating that aliens “remain in the
country . . . merely as matter of favor and permission” and
can be removed at any time without a criminal trial);
Charge to the Grand Juries 11–13 (similar). According to
the Minority Address of the Virginia Legislature (anony­
mously drafted by John Marshall), “[T]he right of remain­
ing in our country is vested in no alien; he enters and
remains by the courtesy of the sovereign power, and that
courtesy may at pleasure be withdrawn” without judicial
process. Address of the Minority in the Virginia Legisla­
ture to the People of that State 9–10 (1799) (Virginia
Minority Address).       Unlike “a grant of land,” the
“[a]dmission of an alien to residence . . . is revocable, like a
permission.” A. Addison, Analysis of the Report of the
Committee of the Virginia Assembly 23 (1800). Removing
a resident alien from the country did not affect “life, lib­
erty, or property,” the Federalists argued, until the alien
became a naturalized citizen. See id., at 23–24; Charge to
the Grand Juries 11–13. That the alien’s permanent
residence was conferred by statute would not have made a
difference. See Nelson 571, 580–582; Teva Pharmaceuti-
cals USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">574</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">___, ___, n. 2
(2015) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 9, n. 2).
   After the Alien Friends Act lapsed in 1800, Congress did
not enact another removal statute for nearly a century.
The States enacted their own removal statutes during this
period, see G. Neuman, Strangers to the Constitution 19–
43 (1996), and I am aware of no decision questioning the
legality of these statutes under State due-process or law­
of-the-land provisions. Beginning in the late 19th century,
the Federal Government reinserted itself into the regula­
tion of immigration. When this Court was presented with
constitutional challenges to Congress’ removal laws, it
initially rejected them for many of the same reasons that

to his own country of an alien who has not complied with
[statutory] conditions . . . . He has not, therefore, been

understanding, “federal immigration laws from 1891 until
1952 made no express provision for judicial review.”
Demore, 538 U. S., at 538 (opinion of O’Connor, J.).
    It was not until the 20th century that this Court held
that nonpenal removal statutes could violate the Due
Process Clause. See Wong Yang Sung v. McGrath, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""104768""><a href=""/opinion/104768/wong-yang-sung-v-mcgrath/""><span class=""volume"">339</span>

Court to apply the then-nascent vagueness doctrine to
immigration statutes. But the Court upheld vague stand­
ards in immigration laws that it likely would not have
tolerated in criminal statutes. See, e.g., Boutilier v. INS,
</pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""107450""><a href=""/opinion/107450/boutilier-v-ins/""><span class=""volume"">387</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">118</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 122 (1967) (“ ‘psychopathic personality’ ”);

(“ ‘undesirable residents’ ”). Until today, this Court has
never held that an immigration statute is unconstitution­

    Thus, for more than a century after the founding, it was,
12                  SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                    THOMAS, J., dissenting

at best, unclear whether federal removal statutes could
violate the Due Process Clause. And until today, this
Court had never deemed a federal removal statute void for
vagueness. Given this history, it is difficult to conclude
that a ban on vague removal statutes is a “settled usag[e]
and mod[e] of proceeding existing in the common and
statute law of England, before the emigration of our ances­
tors” protected by the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process
Clause. Murray’s Lessee, 18 How., at 277.
                               B
   Instead of a longstanding procedure under Murray’s
Lessee, perhaps the vagueness doctrine is really a way to
enforce the separation of powers—specifically, the doctrine
of nondelegation. See Chapman & McConnell, Due Pro­
cess as Separation of Powers, 121 Yale L. J. 1672, 1806
(2012) (“Vague statutes have the effect of delegating law­
making authority to the executive”). Madison raised a
similar objection to the Alien Friends Act, arguing that its
expansive language effectively allowed the President to
exercise legislative (and judicial) power. See Madison’s
Report 369–371. And this Court’s precedents have occa­
sionally described the vagueness doctrine in terms of
nondelegation. See, e.g., Grayned v. City of Rockford, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""108598""><a href=""/opinion/108598/grayned-v-city-of-rockford/""><span class=""volume"">408</span>

   Respondent does not argue that §16(b), as incorporated
by the INA, is an impermissible delegation of power. See
Brief for Respondent 50 (stating that “there is no delega­
tion question” in this case). I would not reach that ques­
tion here, because this case can be resolved on narrower
grounds. See Part I–C, infra. But at first blush, it is not
at all obvious that the nondelegation doctrine would jus­
tify wholesale invalidation of §16(b).
   If §16(b) delegates power in this context, it delegates
power primarily to the Executive Branch entities that
administer the INA—namely, the Attorney General, im­
migration judges, and the Board of Immigration Appeals
(BIA). But Congress does not “delegate” when it merely
authorizes the Executive Branch to exercise a power that
it already has. See AAR, supra, at ___ (opinion of

Framers,” Prakash & Ramsey, The Executive Power Over
Foreign Affairs, 111 Yale L. J. 231, 253 (2001)—described
the power to deport aliens as executive and located it with
the King. Alien friends, Blackstone explained, are “liable
to be sent home whenever the king sees occasion.” 1

our Constitution was ratified, moreover, “[e]minent Eng­

Demore, 538 U. S., at 538 (opinion of O’Connor, J.) (quot­
ing Fong Yue Ting, 149 U. S., at 709). Some of the Feder­
alists defending the Alien Friends Act similarly argued
that the President had the power to remove aliens. See,
e.g., Virginia Debates 35 (statement of George K. Taylor)
(arguing that the power to remove aliens is “most properly
entrusted” with the President, since “[h]e, by the Constitu­
tion, was bound to execute the laws” and is “the executive
officer, with whom all persons and bodies whatever were
accustomed to communicate”); Virginia Minority Address

general safety, in its nature political and not forensic, the
execution of which is properly trusted to the department
which represents the nation in all its interior relations”);
Charge to the Grand Juries 29–30 (“As a measure of na­

(internal quotation marks omitted). Taken together, this
evidence makes it difficult to confidently conclude that the
INA, through §16(b), delegates core legislative power to
the Executive.
   Instead of the Executive, perhaps §16(b) impermissibly
delegates power to the Judiciary, since the Courts of Ap­
peals often review the BIA’s application of §16(b). I as­

  I need not resolve these historical questions today, as
this case can be decided on narrower grounds. If the
vagueness doctrine has any basis in the original meaning
of the Due Process Clause, it must be limited to case-by­
case challenges to particular applications of a statute.
That is what early American courts did when they applied
the rule of lenity. See id., at ___ (slip op., at 10). And that
is how early American courts addressed constitutional
challenges to statutes more generally. See ibid. (“[T]here
is good evidence that [antebellum] courts . . . understood
judicial review to consist ‘of a refusal to give a statute
effect as operative law in resolving a case,’ a notion quite
distinct from our modern practice of ‘ “strik[ing] down”
legislation’ ” (quoting Walsh, Partial Unconstitutionality,

clause was vague as applied to the crime at issue there:
unlawful possession of a short-barreled shotgun. See id.,
at ___ (slip op., at 9).
   In my view, §16(b) is not vague as applied to respond­
ent. When respondent committed his burglaries in 2007
and 2009, he was “sufficiently forewarned . . . that the
statutory consequence . . . is deportation.” De George, 341

Victimization Survey: Victimization During Household
Burglary 1 (Sept. 2010), https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/
pdf/vdhb.pdf (as last visited Apr. 13, 2018). But this
statistic—which measures actual violence against a mem­
ber of the household, see id., at 1, 12—is woefully underin­
clusive. It excludes other potential victims besides house­
hold members—for example, “a police officer, or a
bystande[r] who comes to investigate,” James, supra, at
203. And §16(b) requires only a risk of physical force, not
actual physical force, and that risk would seem to be
present whenever someone is home during the burglary.
Further, Johnson is not conclusive because, unlike ACCA’s
residual clause, §16(b) covers offenses that involve a sub­
stantial risk of physical force “against the person or prop-
erty of another.” (Emphasis added.) Surely the ordinary
case of residential burglary involves at least one of these
risks. According to the statistics referenced by the Court,
most burglaries involve either a forcible entry (e.g., break­
ing a window or slashing a door screen), an attempted
forcible entry, or an unlawful entry when someone is
home. See Bureau of Justice Statistics, supra, at 2 (Table
1). Thus, under any metric, respondent’s convictions for
first-degree residential burglary are crimes of violence
under §16(b).
                                3
    Finally, if facial vagueness challenges are ever appro­
priate, I adhere to my view that a law is not facially vague
“ ‘[i]f any fool would know that a particular category of
conduct would be within the reach of the statute, if there
is an unmistakable core that a reasonable person would
know is forbidden by the law.’ ” Morales, 527 U. S., at 112
(THOMAS, J., dissenting) (quoting Kolender, 461 U. S., at
370–371 (White, J., dissenting)). The residual clause of
ACCA had such a core. See Johnson, 576 U. S., at ___
(slip op., at 10); id., at ___–___ (ALITO, J., dissenting) (slip
20                  SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                    THOMAS, J., dissenting

op., at 14–15). And §16(b) has an even wider core, as THE
CHIEF JUSTICE explains. Thus, the Court should not have
invalidated §16(b), either on its face or as applied to
respondent.
                              II
   Even taking the vagueness doctrine and Johnson at face
value, I disagree with the Court’s decision to invalidate
§16(b). The sole reason that the Court deems §16(b) un­
constitutionally vague is because it reads the statute as
incorporating the categorical approach—specifically, the
“ordinary case” approach from ACCA’s residual clause.
Although the Court mentions “[t]wo features” of §16(b)
that make it vague—the ordinary-case approach and an
imprecise risk standard—the Court admits that the sec­
ond feature is problematic only in combination with the
first. Ante, at 8. Without the ordinary-case approach, the
Court “do[es] not doubt” the constitutionality of §16(b).
Ante, at 10.
   But if the categorical approach renders §16(b) unconsti­
tutionally vague, then constitutional avoidance requires
us to make a reasonable effort to avoid that interpretation.
And a reasonable alternative interpretation is available:
Instead of asking whether the ordinary case of an alien’s
offense presents a substantial risk of physical force, courts
should ask whether the alien’s actual underlying conduct
presents a substantial risk of physical force. I will briefly
discuss the origins of the categorical approach and then
explain why the Court should abandon it for §16(b).

as defined by state law or burglary in the generic sense.
After “devoting 10 pages of [its] opinion to legislative
history,” id., at 603 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and
concurring in judgment), and finding that Congress had
made “an inadvertent casualty in [the] complex drafting
process,” id., at 589–590 (majority opinion), the Court
concluded that ACCA referred to burglary in the generic
sense, id., at 598. The Court then addressed how the
Government would prove that a defendant was convicted
of generic burglary, as opposed to another offense. Id., at
599–602. Taylor rejected the notion that the Government
could introduce evidence about the “particular facts” of the
defendant’s underlying crime. Id., at 600. Instead, the
Court adopted a “categorical approach,” which focused
primarily on the “statutory definition of the prior offense.”
Id., at 602.
  Although Taylor was interpreting one of ACCA’s enu­
merated offenses, this Court later extended the categorical
approach to ACCA’s residual clause. See James, 550
U. S., at 208. That extension required some reworking.
Because ACCA’s enumerated-offenses clause asks whether
a prior conviction “is burglary, arson, or extortion,” 1</pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">8</span>
<span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §924(e)(2)(B)(ii), Taylor instructed courts to focus
on the definition of the underlying crime. The residual
clause, by contrast, asks whether a prior conviction “in­
volves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of
physical injury to another.” §924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Thus, the
Court held that the categorical approach for the residual
clause asks “whether the conduct encompassed by the
elements of the offense, in the ordinary case, presents a
serious potential risk of injury to another.” James, supra,
at 208 (emphasis added). This “ordinary case” approach
allowed courts to apply the residual clause without inquir­
ing into the individual facts of the defendant’s prior crime.
  Taylor gave a few reasons why the categorical approach
was the correct reading of ACCA, see 495 U. S., at 600–

ried about potential violations of the Sixth Amendment. If
the parties could introduce evidence about the defendant’s
underlying conduct, then sentencing proceedings might
devolve into a full-blown minitrial, with factfinding by the
judge instead of the jury. See id., at 24–26; Taylor, supra,
at 601. While this Court’s decision in Almendarez-Torres
v. United States, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""118188""><a href=""/opinion/118188/almendarez-torres-v-united-states/""><span class=""volume"">523</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">224</span></a></span><pre class=""inline""> (1998), allows judges to
find facts about a defendant’s prior convictions, a full-
blown minitrial would look “too much like” the kind of
factfinding that the Sixth Amendment requires the jury to
conduct. Shepard, 544 U. S., at 25. By construing ACCA
to require a categorical approach, then, the Court was
following “[t]he rule of reading statutes to avoid serious
risks of unconstitutionality.” Ibid.

  I disagreed with the Court’s decision to extend the
categorical approach to ACCA’s residual clause. See
James, 550 U. S., at 231–232 (dissenting opinion). The
categorical approach was an “ ‘unnecessary exercise,’ ” I
explained, because it created the same Sixth Amendment
problem that it tried to avoid. Id., at 231. Absent waiver,
a defendant has the right to have a jury find “every fact
that is by law a basis for imposing or increasing punish­
ment,” including the fact of a prior conviction. Apprendi v.
New Jersey, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""118381""><a href=""/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/""><span class=""volume"">530</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">466</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 501 (2000) (THOMAS, J., concur­

wants to enhance a defendant’s sentence based on his
prior convictions, it must put those convictions in the
indictment and prove them to a jury beyond a reasonable
doubt.6
                              B
  My objection aside, the ordinary-case approach soon
created problems of its own. The Court’s attempt to avoid
the Scylla of the Sixth Amendment steered it straight into
the Charybdis of the Fifth. The ordinary-case approach
that was created to honor the individual right to a jury is
now, according to the Court, so vague that it deprives
individuals of due process.
  I see no good reason for the Court to persist in reading
the ordinary-case approach into §16(b). The text of §16(b)
does not mandate the ordinary-case approach, the con­
cerns that led this Court to adopt it do not apply here, and
there are no prudential reasons for retaining it. In my
view, we should abandon the categorical approach for
§16(b).

   6 The Sixth Amendment is, thus, not a reason to maintain the cate­

gorical approach in criminal cases. Contra, ante, at 13–14 (plurality
opinion). Even if it were, the Sixth Amendment does not apply in
immigration cases like this one. See Part II–B–2, infra. The plurality
contends that, if it must contort the text of §16(b) to avoid a Sixth
Amendment problem in criminal cases, then it must also contort the
text of §16(b) in immigration cases, even though the Sixth Amendment
problem does not arise in the immigration context. See ante, at 13–14,
15. But, as I have explained elsewhere, this “lowest common denomi­
nator” approach to constitutional avoidance is both ahistorical and
illogical. See Clark v. Martinez, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""137741""><a href=""/opinion/137741/clark-v-martinez/""><span class=""volume"">543</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">371</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 395–401 (2005) (dissent­

the United States. </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">8</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). Aggra­
vated felonies include “crime[s] of violence” as defined in
§16. §1101(a)(43)(F). Section 16, in turn, defines crimes of
violence as follows:
        “(a) an offense that has as an element the use, at­
     tempted use, or threatened use of physical force
     against the person or property of another, or
        “(b) any other offense that is a felony and that, by
     its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical
     force against the person or property of another may be
     used in the course of committing the offense.”
   At first glance, §16(b) is not clear about the precise
question it poses. On the one hand, the statute might
refer to the metaphysical “nature” of the offense and ask
whether it ordinarily involves a substantial risk of physi­
cal force. On the other hand, the statute might refer to
the underlying facts of the offense that the offender com­
mitted; the words “by its nature,” “substantial risk,” and
“may” would mean only that an offender who engages in
risky conduct cannot benefit from the fortuitous fact that
physical force was not actually used during his offense.
The text can bear either interpretation. See Nijhawan v.
Holder, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""145861""><a href=""/opinion/145861/nijhawan-v-holder/""><span class=""volume"">557</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">29</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 33–34 (2009) (“[I]n ordinary speech

and “offense” to refer to an offender’s actual underlying
conduct.7

  Although both interpretations are linguistically possi­
ble, several factors indicate that the underlying-conduct
approach is the better one. To begin, §16(b) asks whether
an offense “involves” a substantial risk of force. The word
“involves” suggests that the offense must necessarily
include a substantial risk of force. See The New Oxford
Dictionary of English 962 (2001) (“include (something) as a

a necessary circumstance, condition, or consequence”);
Oxford American Dictionary 349 (1980) (“1. to contain
within itself, to make necessary as a condition or result”).
That condition is always satisfied if the Government must
prove that the alien’s underlying conduct involves a sub­
stantial risk of force, but it is not always satisfied if the
Government need only prove that the “ordinary case”
involves such a risk. See Johnson, 576 U. S., at ___
(ALITO, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 12). Tellingly, the other
aggravated felonies in the INA that use the word “in­
volves” employ the underlying-conduct approach. See </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">8</span>
<span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §1101(a)(43)(M)(i) (“an offense that involves fraud
or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds
$10,000”); §1101(h)(3) (“any crime of reckless driving or of
driving while intoxicated or under the influence of alcohol
or of prohibited substances if such crime involves personal
injury to another”). As do the similarly worded provisions
of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, the bill
that contained §16(b). See, e.g., 98 Stat. 2059 (elevating
the burden of proof for the release of “a person found not
guilty only by reason of insanity of an offense involving
bodily injury to, or serious damage to the property of,
another person, or involving a substantial risk of such
injury or damage”); id., at 2068 (establishing the sentence
for drug offenses “involving” specific quantities and types
of drugs); id., at 2137 (defining violent crimes in aid of
racketeering to include “attempting or conspiring to com­
mit a crime involving maiming, assault with a dangerous
weapon, or assault resulting in serious bodily injury”).
  A comparison of §16(b) and §16(a) further highlights
why the former likely adopts an underlying-conduct ap­
proach. Section 16(a) covers offenses that have the use,
attempted use, or threatened use of physical force “as an
element.” Because §16(b) covers “other” offenses and is
separated from §16(a) by the disjunctive word “or,” the
natural inference is that §16(b) asks a different question.

                    THOMAS, J., dissenting

In other words, §16(b) must require immigration judges to
look beyond the elements of an offense to determine
whether it involves a substantial risk of physical force.
But if the elements are insufficient, where else should
immigration judges look to determine the riskiness of an
offense? Two options are possible, only one of which is
workable.
   The first option is to consult the underlying facts of the
alien’s crime and then assess its riskiness. This approach
would provide a definitive answer in every case. And
courts are already familiar with this kind of inquiry. Cf.
Johnson, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 12) (noting that “doz­
ens” of similarly worded laws ask courts to assess “the
riskiness of conduct in which an individual defendant
engages on a particular occasion”). Nothing suggests that
Congress imposed a more limited inquiry when it enacted
§16(b) in 1984. At the time, Congress had not yet enacted
ACCA’s residual clause, this Court had not yet created the
categorical approach, and this Court had not yet recog­
nized a Sixth Amendment limit on judicial factfinding at
sentencing, see Chambers v. United States, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""145923""><a href=""/opinion/145923/chambers-v-united-states/""><span class=""volume"">555</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">122</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">,
132 (2009) (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment).
   The second option is to imagine the “ordinary case” of
the alien’s crime and then assess the riskiness of that
hypothetical offense. But the phrase “ordinary case” does
not appear in the statute. And imagining the ordinary
case, the Court reminds us, is “hopeless[ly] indetermi­
na[te],” “wholly ‘speculative,’ ” and mere “guesswork.”
Ante, at 7, 24 (quoting Johnson, supra, at ___–___ (slip op.,
at 5, 7)); see also Chambers, supra, at 133 (opinion of
ALITO, J.) (observing that the categorical approach is
“nearly impossible to apply consistently”). Because courts
disfavor interpretations that make a statute impossible to
apply, see A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law 63 (2012),
this Court should reject the ordinary-case approach for
§16(b) and adopt the underlying-facts approach instead.
28                  SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                     THOMAS, J., dissenting

See Johnson, supra, at ___ (ALITO, J., dissenting) (slip op.,
at 10) (“When another interpretation is ready at hand,
why should we assume that Congress gave the clause a
meaning that is impossible—or even, exceedingly diffi­
cult—to apply”).
                              2
   That the categorical approach is not the better reading
of §16(b) should not be surprising, since the categorical
approach was never really about the best reading of the
text. As explained, this Court adopted that approach to
avoid a potential Sixth Amendment problem with sentenc­
ing judges conducting minitrials to determine a defend­
ant’s past conduct. But even assuming the categorical
approach solved this Sixth Amendment problem in crimi­
nal cases, no such problem arises in immigration cases.
“[T]he provisions of the Constitution securing the right of
trial by jury have no application” in a removal proceeding.
Turner, 194 U. S., at 290. And, in criminal cases, the
underlying-conduct approach would be perfectly constitu­
tional if the Government included the defendant’s prior
conduct in the indictment, tried it to a jury, and proved it
beyond a reasonable doubt. See Johnson, 576 U. S., at ___
(ALITO, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 12). Nothing in §16(b)
prohibits the Government from proceeding this way, so the
plurality is wrong to suggest that the underlying-conduct
approach would necessarily “ping-pong us from one consti­
tutional issue to another.” Ante, at 14.
   If constitutional avoidance applies here at all, it re­
quires us to reject the categorical approach for §16(b).
According to the Court, the categorical approach is uncon­
stitutionally vague. And, all agree that the underlying-
conduct approach would not be. See Johnson, 576 U. S., at
___ (majority opinion) (slip op., at 12) (“[W]e do not doubt

world conduct”). Thus, if the underlying-conduct approach
is a “reasonabl[e]” interpretation of §16(b), it is our “plain
duty” to adopt it. United States ex rel. Attorney General v.
Delaware & Hudson Co., </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""97023""><a href=""/opinion/97023/united-states-ex-rel-attorney-general-v-delaware-hudson-co/""><span class=""volume"">213</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">366</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 407 (1909). And it
is reasonable, as explained above.
   In Johnson, the Court declined to adopt the underlying-
conduct approach for ACCA’s residual clause. See 576
U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 12–13). The Court concluded
that the categorical approach was the only reasonable
reading of ACCA because the residual clause uses the
word “convictions.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 13). The Court
also stressed the “utter impracticability of requiring a
sentencing court to reconstruct, long after the original
conviction, the conduct underlying that conviction.” Ibid.
   Neither of these arguments is persuasive with respect to
the INA. Moreover, this Court has already rejected them.
In Nijhawan, this Court unanimously concluded that one
of the aggravated felonies in the INA—“an offense that . . .
involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or
victims exceeds $10,000,” §1101(a)(43)(M)(i)—applies the
underlying-conduct approach, not the categorical ap­
proach. 557 U. S., at 32. Although the INA also refers to
“convict[ions],” §1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), the Court was not
swayed by that argument. The word “convict[ion]” means
only that the defendant’s underlying conduct must “ ‘be
tied to the specific counts covered by the conviction,’ ” not
“acquitted or dismissed counts or general conduct.” Id., at
42. As for the supposed practical problems with proving
an alien’s prior conduct, the Court did not find that argu­
ment persuasive either. “[T]he ‘sole purpose’ of the ‘ag­
gravated felony’ inquiry,” the Court explained, “ ‘is to
ascertain the nature of a prior conviction; it is not an
invitation to relitigate the conviction itself.’ ” Ibid. And
because the INA places the burden on the Government to
prove an alien’s conduct by clear and convincing evidence,
§1229a(c)(3)(A), “uncertainties caused by the passage of
30                   SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                     THOMAS, J., dissenting

time are likely to count in the alien’s favor,” id., at 42.
   There are additional reasons why the practical problems
identified in Johnson should not matter for §16(b)—even
assuming they should have mattered for ACCA’s residual
clause, see Lewis v. Chicago, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""146985""><a href=""/opinion/146985/lewis-v-chicago/""><span class=""volume"">560</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">205</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 217 (2010)
(“[I]t is not our task to assess the consequences of each
approach and adopt the one that produces the least mis­
chief. Our charge is to give effect to the law Congress
enacted”). In a removal proceeding, any difficulties with
identifying an alien’s past conduct will fall on immigration
judges, not federal courts. But those judges are already
accustomed to finding facts about the conduct underlying
an alien’s prior convictions, since some of the INA’s aggra­
vated felonies employ the underlying-conduct approach.
The BIA has instructed immigration judges to determine
such conduct based on “any evidence admissible in re-
moval proceedings,” not just the elements of the offense or the
record of conviction. See Matter of Babaisakov, 24 I. & N.
Dec. 306, 307 (2007). No one has submitted any evidence
that the BIA’s approach has been “utter[ly] impracti­
cab[le]” or “daunting[ly] difficul[t]” in practice. Ante, at
15. And even if it were, “how much time the agency wants
to devote to the resolution of particular issues is . . . a
question for the agency itself.” Ali v. Mukasey, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""1301207""><a href=""/opinion/1301207/ali-v-mukasey/""><span class=""volume"">521</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.3d</span>
<span class=""page"">737</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 741 (CA7 2008). Hypothetical burdens on the BIA
should not influence how this Court interprets §16(b).
   In short, we should not blithely assume that the reasons
why this Court adopted the categorical approach for
ACCA’s residual clause also apply to the INA’s list of
aggravated felonies. As Nijhawan explained, “the ‘aggra­
vated felony’ statute, unlike ACCA, contains some lan­
guage that refers to generic crimes and some language
that almost certainly refers to the specific circumstances
in which a crime was committed.” 557 U. S., at 38. “The
question” in each case is “to which category [the aggra-
vated felony] belongs.” Ibid. As I have explained, §16(b)

belongs in the underlying-conduct category. Because that
is the better reading of §16(b)’s text—or at least a reason­
able reading—the Court should have adopted it here.
                               3
   I see no prudential reason for maintaining the categori­
cal approach for §16(b). The Court notes that the Gov­
ernment “explicitly acknowledges” that §16(b) employs the
categorical approach. Ante, at 9. But we cannot permit
the Government’s concessions to dictate how we interpret
a statute, much less cause us to invalidate a statute en­

We should have followed that established practice here.
   Nor should stare decisis prevent us from rejecting the
categorical approach for §16(b). This Court has never held
that §16(b) incorporates the ordinary-case approach.
Although Leocal held that §16(b) incorporates a version of
the categorical approach, the Court must not feel bound by
that decision, as it largely overrules it today. See ante, at
22, n. 7. Surely the Court cannot credibly invoke stare
32                  SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                     THOMAS, J., dissenting

decisis to defend the categorical approach—the same
approach it says only a “lunatic” would continue to apply.
Ante, at 24. If the Court views the categorical approach
that way—the same way Johnson viewed it—then it must
also agree that “[s]tanding by [the categorical approach]
would undermine, rather than promote, the goals that
stare decisis is meant to serve.” 576 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,
at 15). That is especially true if the Court’s decision leads
to the invalidation of scores of similarly worded state and
federal statutes, which seems even more likely after today
than it did after Johnson. Instead of adhering to an inter­
pretation that it thinks unconstitutional and then using
that interpretation to strike down another statute, the
Court should have taken this opportunity to abandon the
categorical approach for §16(b) once and for all.
                          *    *   *
  The Court’s decision today is triply flawed. It unneces­
sarily extends our incorrect decision in Johnson. It uses a
constitutional doctrine with dubious origins to invalidate
yet another statute (while calling into question countless
more). And it does all this in the name of a statutory
interpretation that we should have discarded long ago.
Because I cannot follow the Court down any of these rab­
bit holes, I respectfully dissent.

       SESSIONS, ATTORNEY GENERAL v. DIMAYA

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT

No. 15–1498. Argued January 17, 2017—Reargued October 2, 2017—
                     Decided April 17, 2018
The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) virtually guarantees that
  any alien convicted of an “aggravated felony” after entering the Unit-
  ed States will be deported. See 8 U. S. C. §§1227(a)(2)(A)(iii),
  1229b(a)(3), (b)(1)(C). An aggravated felony includes “a crime of vio-
  lence (as defined in [18 U. S. C. §16] . . . ) for which the term of im-
  prisonment [is] at least one year.” §1101(a)(43)(f). Section 16’s defi-
  nition of a crime of violence is divided into two clauses—often
  referred to as the elements clause, §16(a), and the residual clause,
  §16(b). The residual clause, the provision at issue here, defines a
  “crime of violence” as “any other offense that is a felony and that, by
  its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the
  person or property of another may be used in the course of commit-
  ting the offense.” To decide whether a person’s conviction falls within
  the scope of that clause, courts apply the categorical approach. This
  approach has courts ask not whether “the particular facts” underly-
  ing a conviction created a substantial risk, Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543
  U. S. 1, 7, nor whether the statutory elements of a crime require the
  creation of such a risk in each and every case, but whether “the ordi-
  nary case” of an offense poses the requisite risk, James v. United
  States, 550 U. S. 192, 208.
     Respondent James Dimaya is a lawful permanent resident of the
  United States with two convictions for first-degree burglary under
  California law. After his second offense, the Government sought to
  deport him as an aggravated felon. An Immigration Judge and the
  Board of Immigration Appeals held that California first-degree bur-
  glary is a “crime of violence” under §16(b). While Dimaya’s appeal
  was pending in the Ninth Circuit, this Court held that a similar re-
2                        SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                                Syllabus

    sidual clause in the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA)—defining
    “violent felony” as any felony that “otherwise involves conduct that
    presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,” 18
    U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)—was unconstitutionally “void for vagueness”
    under the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. Johnson v. Unit-
    ed States, 576 U. S. ___, ___. Relying on Johnson, the Ninth Circuit
    held that §16(b), as incorporated into the INA, was also unconstitu-
    tionally vague.
Held: The judgment is affirmed.
803 F. 3d 1110, affirmed.
     JUSTICE KAGAN delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to
  Parts I, III, IV–B, and V, concluding that §16’s residual clause is un-
  constitutionally vague. Pp. 6–11, 16–25.
     (a) A straightforward application of Johnson effectively resolves
  this case. Section 16(b) has the same two features as ACCA’s residu-
  al clause—an ordinary-case requirement and an ill-defined risk
  threshold—combined in the same constitutionally problematic way.
  To begin, ACCA’s residual clause created “grave uncertainty about
  how to estimate the risk posed by a crime” because it “tie[d] the judi-
  cial assessment of risk” to a speculative hypothesis about the crime’s
  “ordinary case,” but provided no guidance on how to figure out what
  that ordinary case was. 576 U. S., at ___. Compounding that uncer-
  tainty, ACCA’s residual clause layered an imprecise “serious poten-
  tial risk” standard on top of the requisite “ordinary case” inquiry.
  The combination of “indeterminacy about how to measure the risk
  posed by a crime [and] indeterminacy about how much risk it takes
  for the crime to qualify as a violent felony,” id., at ___, resulted in
  “more unpredictability and arbitrariness than the Due Process
  Clause tolerates,” id., at ___. Section 16(b) suffers from those same
  two flaws. Like ACCA’s residual clause, §16(b) calls for a court to
  identify a crime’s “ordinary case” in order to measure the crime’s risk
  but “offers no reliable way” to discern what the ordinary version of
  any offense looks like. Id., at ___. And its “substantial risk” thresh-
  old is no more determinate than ACCA’s “serious potential risk”
  standard. Thus, the same “[t]wo features” that “conspire[d] to make”
  ACCA’s residual clause unconstitutionally vague also exist in §16(b),
  with the same result. Id., at ___. Pp. 6–11.
     (b) The Government identifies three textual discrepancies between
  ACCA’s residual clause and §16(b) that it claims make §16(b) easier
  to apply and thus cure the constitutional infirmity. None, however,
  relates to the pair of features that Johnson found to produce imper-
  missible vagueness or otherwise makes the statutory inquiry more
  determinate. Pp. 16–24.
       (1) First, the Government argues that §16(b)’s express require-
                   Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)                     3

                              Syllabus

ment (absent from ACCA) that the risk arise from acts taken “in the
course of committing the offense,” serves as a “temporal restriction”—
in other words, a court applying §16(b) may not “consider risks aris-
ing after” the offense’s commission is over. Brief for Petitioner 31.
But this is not a meaningful limitation: In the ordinary case of any of-
fense, the riskiness of a crime arises from events occurring during its
commission, not events occurring later. So with or without the tem-
poral language, a court applying the ordinary case approach, whether
in §16’s or ACCA’s residual clause, would do the same thing—ask
what usually happens when a crime is committed. The phrase “in
the course of” makes no difference as to either outcome or clarity and
cannot cure the statutory indeterminacy Johnson described.
  Second, the Government says that the §16(b) inquiry, which focus-
es on the risk of “physical force,” “trains solely” on the conduct typi-
cally involved in a crime. Brief for Petitioner 36. In contrast,
ACCA’s residual clause asked about the risk of “physical injury,”
requiring a second inquiry into a speculative “chain of causation that
could possibly result in a victim’s injury.” Ibid. However, this Court
has made clear that “physical force” means “force capable of causing
physical pain or injury.” Johnson v. United States, 559 U. S. 133,
140. So under §16(b) too, a court must not only identify the conduct
typically involved in a crime, but also gauge its potential consequenc-
es. Thus, the force/injury distinction does not clarify a court’s analy-
sis of whether a crime qualifies as violent.
     Third, the Government notes that §16(b) avoids the vagueness of
ACCA’s residual clause because it is not preceded by a “confusing list
of exemplar crimes.” Brief for Petitioner 38. Those enumerated
crimes were in fact too varied to assist this Court in giving ACCA’s
residual clause meaning. But to say that they failed to resolve the
clause’s vagueness is hardly to say they caused the problem. Pp. 16–
21.
     (2) The Government also relies on judicial experience with
§16(b), arguing that because it has divided lower courts less often
and resulted in only one certiorari grant, it must be clearer than its
ACCA counterpart. But in fact, a host of issues respecting §16(b)’s
application to specific crimes divide the federal appellate courts. And
while this Court has only heard oral arguments in two §16(b) cases,
this Court vacated the judgments in a number of other §16(b) cases,
remanding them for further consideration in light of ACCA decisions.
Pp. 21–24.
  JUSTICE KAGAN, joined by JUSTICE GINSBURG, JUSTICE BREYER, and
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, concluded in Parts II and IV–A:
  (a) The Government argues that a more permissive form of the
void-for-vagueness doctrine applies than the one Johnson employed
4                           SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                                    Syllabus

    because the removal of an alien is a civil matter rather than a crimi-
    nal case. This Court’s precedent forecloses that argument. In Jor-
    dan v. De George, 341 U. S. 223, the Court considered what vague-
    ness standard applied in removal cases and concluded that, “in view
    of the grave nature of deportation,” the most exacting vagueness
    standard must apply. Id., at 231. Nothing in the ensuing years calls
    that reasoning into question. This Court has reiterated that deporta-
    tion is “a particularly severe penalty,” which may be of greater con-
    cern to a convicted alien than “any potential jail sentence.” Jae Lee v.
    United States, 582 U. S. ___, ___. Pp. 4–6.
       (b) Section 16(b) demands a categorical, ordinary-case approach.
    For reasons expressed in Johnson, that approach cannot be aban-
    doned in favor of a conduct-based approach, which asks about the
    specific way in which a defendant committed a crime. To begin, the
    Government once again “has not asked [the Court] to abandon the
    categorical approach in residual-clause cases,” suggesting the fact-
    based approach is an untenable interpretation of §16(b). 576 U. S., at
    ___. Moreover, a fact-based approach would generate constitutional
    questions. In any event, §16(b)’s text demands a categorical ap-
    proach. This Court’s decisions have consistently understood lan-
    guage in the residual clauses of both ACCA and §16 to refer to “the
    statute of conviction, not to the facts of each defendant’s conduct.”
    Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575, 601. And the words “by its na-
    ture” in §16(b) even more clearly compel an inquiry into an offense’s
    normal and characteristic quality—that is, what the offense ordinari-
    ly entails. Finally, given the daunting difficulties of accurately “re-
    construct[ing],” often many years later, “the conduct underlying [a]
    conviction,” the conduct-based approach’s “utter impracticability”—
    and associated inequities—is as great in §16(b) as in ACCA. John-
    son, 576 U. S., at ___. Pp. 12–15.
       JUSTICE GORSUCH, agreeing that the Immigration and Nationality
    Act provision at hand is unconstitutionally vague for the reasons
    identified in Johnson v. United States, 576 U. S. ___, concluded that
    the void for vagueness doctrine, at least properly conceived, serves as
    a faithful expression of ancient due process and separation of powers
    principles the Framers recognized as vital to ordered liberty under
    the Constitution. The Government’s argument that a less-than-fair-
    notice standard should apply where (as here) a person faces only civ-
    il, not criminal, consequences from a statute’s operation is unavail-
    ing. In the criminal context, the law generally must afford “ordinary
    people . . . fair notice of the conduct it punishes,” id., at ___, and it is
    hard to see how the Due Process Clause might often require any less
    than that in the civil context. Nor is there any good reason to single
    out civil deportation for assessment under the fair notice standard
                     Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)                   5

                               Syllabus

  because of the special gravity of its penalty when so many civil laws
  impose so many similarly severe sanctions. Alternative approaches
  that do not concede the propriety of the categorical ordinary case
  analysis are more properly addressed in another case, involving ei-
  ther the Immigration and Nationality Act or another statute, where
  the parties have a chance to be heard. Pp. 1–19.

   Three Terms ago, in Johnson v. United States, this
Court held that part of a federal law’s definition of “violent
felony” was impermissibly vague. See 576 U. S. ___
(2015). The question in this case is whether a similarly
worded clause in a statute’s definition of “crime of vio-
lence” suffers from the same constitutional defect. Adher-
ing to our analysis in Johnson, we hold that it does.
                              I
  The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) renders
deportable any alien convicted of an “aggravated felony”
after entering the United States.              8 U. S. C.
§1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). Such an alien is also ineligible for
cancellation of removal, a form of discretionary relief
allowing some deportable aliens to remain in the country.
See §§1229b(a)(3), (b)(1)(C). Accordingly, removal is a
virtual certainty for an alien found to have an aggravated
2                       SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                          Opinion of the Court

felony conviction, no matter how long he has previously
resided here.
   The INA defines “aggravated felony” by listing numer-
ous offenses and types of offenses, often with cross-
references to federal criminal statutes. §1101(a)(43); see
Luna Torres v. Lynch, 578 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at
2). According to one item on that long list, an aggravated
felony includes “a crime of violence (as defined in section
16 of title 18 . . . ) for which the term of imprisonment [is]
at least one year.” §1101(a)(43)(F). The specified statute,
18 U. S. C. §16, provides the federal criminal code’s defini-
tion of “crime of violence.” Its two parts, often known as
the elements clause and the residual clause, cover:
          “(a) an offense that has as an element the use, at-
       tempted use, or threatened use of physical force
       against the person or property of another, or
          “(b) any other offense that is a felony and that, by
       its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical
       force against the person or property of another may be
       used in the course of committing the offense.”
Section 16(b), the residual clause, is the part of the statute
at issue in this case.
   To decide whether a person’s conviction “falls within the
ambit” of that clause, courts use a distinctive form of what
we have called the categorical approach. Leocal v. Ash-
croft, 543 U. S. 1, 7 (2004). The question, we have ex-
plained, is not whether “the particular facts” underlying a
conviction posed the substantial risk that §16(b) demands.
Ibid. Neither is the question whether the statutory ele-
ments of a crime require (or entail) the creation of such a
risk in each case that the crime covers.1 The §16(b) in-
——————
    1 The
        analysis thus differs from the form of categorical approach used
to determine whether a prior conviction is for a particular listed offense
(say, murder or arson). In that context, courts ask what the elements of
a given crime always require—in effect, what is legally necessary for a
                     Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)                   3

                         Opinion of the Court

quiry instead turns on the “nature of the offense” gener-
ally speaking. Ibid. (referring to §16(b)’s “by its nature”
language). More precisely, §16(b) requires a court to ask
whether “the ordinary case” of an offense poses the requi-
site risk. James v. United States, 550 U. S. 192, 208
(2007); see infra, at 7.
   In the case before us, Immigration Judges employed
that analysis to conclude that respondent James Dimaya
is deportable as an aggravated felon. A native of the
Philippines, Dimaya has resided lawfully in the United
States since 1992. But he has not always acted lawfully
during that time. Twice, Dimaya was convicted of first-
degree burglary under California law. See Cal. Penal
Code Ann. §§459, 460(a). Following his second offense, the
Government initiated a removal proceeding against him.
Both an Immigration Judge and the Board of Immigration
Appeals held that California first-degree burglary is a
“crime of violence” under §16(b). “[B]y its nature,” the
Board reasoned, the offense “carries a substantial risk of
the use of force.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a. Dimaya
sought review in the Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit.
   While his appeal was pending, this Court held unconsti-
tutional part of the definition of “violent felony” in the
Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U. S. C. §924(e).
ACCA prescribes a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence
if a person convicted of being a felon in possession of a
firearm has three prior convictions for a “violent felony.”
§924(e)(1). The definition of that statutory term goes as
follows:
     “any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term ex-
     ceeding one year . . . that—
       “(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or
——————
conviction. See, e.g., Descamps v. United States, 570 U. S. 254, 260–261
(2013); Moncrieffe v. Holder, 569 U. S. 184, 190–191 (2013).

      threatened use of physical force against the person of
      another; or
        “(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of
      explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents
      a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.”
      §924(e)(2)(B) (emphasis added).
The italicized portion of that definition (like the similar
language of §16(b)) came to be known as the statute’s
residual clause. In Johnson v. United States, the Court
declared that clause “void for vagueness” under the Fifth
Amendment’s Due Process Clause. 576 U. S., at ___–___
(slip op., at 13–14).
   Relying on Johnson, the Ninth Circuit held that §16(b),
as incorporated into the INA, was also unconstitutionally
vague, and accordingly ruled in Dimaya’s favor. See Di-
maya v. Lynch, 803 F. 3d 1110, 1120 (2015). Two other
Circuits reached the same conclusion, but a third distin-
guished ACCA’s residual clause from §16’s.2 We granted
certiorari to resolve the conflict. Lynch v. Dimaya, 579
U. S. ___ (2016).
                             II
   “The prohibition of vagueness in criminal statutes,” our
decision in Johnson explained, is an “essential” of due
process, required by both “ordinary notions of fair play and
the settled rules of law.” 576 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4)
(quoting Connally v. General Constr. Co., 269 U. S. 385,
391 (1926)). The void-for-vagueness doctrine, as we have
called it, guarantees that ordinary people have “fair no-
tice” of the conduct a statute proscribes. Papachristou v.
Jacksonville, 405 U. S. 156, 162 (1972). And the doctrine

guards against arbitrary or discriminatory law enforce-
ment by insisting that a statute provide standards to
govern the actions of police officers, prosecutors, juries,
and judges. See Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S. 352, 357–
358 (1983). In that sense, the doctrine is a corollary of the
separation of powers—requiring that Congress, rather
than the executive or judicial branch, define what conduct
is sanctionable and what is not. Cf. id., at 358, n. 7 (“[I]f
the legislature could set a net large enough to catch all
possible offenders, and leave it to the courts to step inside
and say who could be rightfully detained, [it would] substi-
tute the judicial for the legislative department” (internal
quotation marks omitted)).
   The Government argues that a less searching form of
the void-for-vagueness doctrine applies here than in John-
son because this is not a criminal case. See Brief for Peti-
tioner 13–15. As the Government notes, this Court has
stated that “[t]he degree of vagueness that the Constitu-
tion [allows] depends in part on the nature of the enact-
ment”: In particular, the Court has “expressed greater
tolerance of enactments with civil rather than criminal
penalties because the consequences of imprecision are
qualitatively less severe.” Hoffman Estates v. Flipside,
Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U. S. 489, 498–499 (1982). The
removal of an alien is a civil matter. See Arizona v. United
States, 567 U. S. 387, 396 (2012). Hence, the Govern-
ment claims, the need for clarity is not so strong; even a
law too vague to support a conviction or sentence may be
good enough to sustain a deportation order. See Brief for
Petitioner 25–26.
   But this Court’s precedent forecloses that argument,
because we long ago held that the most exacting vague-
ness standard should apply in removal cases. In Jordan v.
De George, we considered whether a provision of immigra-
tion law making an alien deportable if convicted of a
“crime involving moral turpitude” was “sufficiently defi-
6                   SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                     Opinion of the Court

nite.” 341 U. S. 223, 229 (1951). That provision, we noted,
“is not a criminal statute” (as §16(b) actually is). Id., at
231; supra, at 1–2. Still, we chose to test (and ultimately
uphold) it “under the established criteria of the ‘void for
vagueness’ doctrine” applicable to criminal laws. 341
U. S., at 231. That approach was demanded, we ex-
plained, “in view of the grave nature of deportation,”
ibid.—a “drastic measure,” often amounting to lifelong
“banishment or exile,” ibid. (quoting Fong Haw Tan v.
Phelan, 333 U. S. 6, 10 (1948)).
   Nothing in the ensuing years calls that reasoning into
question. To the contrary, this Court has reiterated that
deportation is “a particularly severe penalty,” which may
be of greater concern to a convicted alien than “any poten-
tial jail sentence.” Jae Lee v. United States, 582 U. S. ___,
___ (2017) (slip op., at 11) (quoting Padilla v. Kentucky,
559 U. S. 356, 365, 368 (2010)). And we have observed
that as federal immigration law increasingly hinged de-
portation orders on prior convictions, removal proceedings
became ever more “intimately related to the criminal
process.” Chaidez v. United States, 568 U. S. 342, 352
(2013) (quoting Padilla, 559 U. S., at 365). What follows,
as Jordan recognized, is the use of the same standard in
the two settings.
   For that reason, the Government cannot take refuge in a
more permissive form of the void-for-vagueness doctrine
than the one Johnson employed. To salvage §16’s residual
clause, even for use in immigration hearings, the Gov-
ernment must instead persuade us that it is materially
clearer than its now-invalidated ACCA counterpart.
That is the issue we next address, as guided by Johnson’s
analysis.
                           III
  Johnson is a straightforward decision, with equally
straightforward application here. Its principal section
                 Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)            7

                     Opinion of the Court

begins as follows: “Two features of [ACCA’s] residual
clause conspire to make it unconstitutionally vague.” 576
U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5). The opinion then identifies
each of those features and explains how their joinder
produced “hopeless indeterminacy,” inconsistent with due
process. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 7). And with that reason-
ing, Johnson effectively resolved the case now before us.
For §16’s residual clause has the same two features as
ACCA’s, combined in the same constitutionally problem-
atic way. Consider those two, just as Johnson described
them:
   “In the first place,” Johnson explained, ACCA’s residual
clause created “grave uncertainty about how to estimate
the risk posed by a crime” because it “tie[d] the judicial
assessment of risk” to a hypothesis about the crime’s
“ordinary case.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 5). Under the
clause, a court focused on neither the “real-world facts”
nor the bare “statutory elements” of an offense. Ibid.
Instead, a court was supposed to “imagine” an “idealized
ordinary case of the crime”—or otherwise put, the court
had to identify the “kind of conduct the ‘ordinary case’ of a
crime involves.” Ibid. But how, Johnson asked, should a
court figure that out? By using a “statistical analysis of
the state reporter? A survey? Expert evidence? Google?
Gut instinct?” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).
ACCA provided no guidance, rendering judicial accounts of
the “ordinary case” wholly “speculative.” Ibid. Johnson
gave as its prime example the crime of attempted bur-
glary. One judge, contemplating the “ordinary case,” would
imagine the “violent encounter” apt to ensue when a
“would-be burglar [was] spotted by a police officer [or]
private security guard.” Id., at ___–___ (slip op., at 5–6).
Another judge would conclude that “any confrontation”
was more “likely to consist of [an observer’s] yelling ‘Who’s
there?’ . . . and the burglar’s running away.” Id., at ___
(slip op., at 6). But how could either judge really know?
8                   SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                     Opinion of the Court

“The residual clause,” Johnson summarized, “offer[ed] no
reliable way” to discern what the ordinary version of any
offense looked like. Ibid. And without that, no one could
tell how much risk the offense generally posed.
   Compounding that first uncertainty, Johnson continued,
was a second: ACCA’s residual clause left unclear what
threshold level of risk made any given crime a “violent
felony.” See ibid. The Court emphasized that this feature
alone would not have violated the void-for-vagueness
doctrine: Many perfectly constitutional statutes use im-
precise terms like “serious potential risk” (as in ACCA’s
residual clause) or “substantial risk” (as in §16’s). The
problem came from layering such a standard on top of the
requisite “ordinary case” inquiry. As the Court explained:
    “[W]e do not doubt the constitutionality of laws that
    call for the application of a qualitative standard such
    as ‘substantial risk’ to real-world conduct; the law is
    full of instances where a man’s fate depends on his es-
    timating rightly . . . some matter of degree[.] The re-
    sidual clause, however, requires application of the ‘se-
    rious potential risk’ standard to an idealized ordinary
    case of the crime. Because the elements necessary to
    determine the imaginary ideal are uncertain[,] this
    abstract inquiry offers significantly less predictability
    than one that deals with the actual . . . facts.” Id., at
    ___ (slip op., at 12) (some internal quotation marks,
    citations, and alterations omitted).
So much less predictability, in fact, that ACCA’s residual
clause could not pass constitutional muster. As the Court
again put the point, in the punch line of its decision: “By
combining indeterminacy about how to measure the risk
posed by a crime with indeterminacy about how much risk
it takes for the crime to qualify as a violent felony, the
residual clause” violates the guarantee of due process. Id.,

                          Opinion of the Court

at ___ (slip op., at 6).3
   Section 16’s residual clause violates that promise in just
the same way. To begin where Johnson did, §16(b) also
calls for a court to identify a crime’s “ordinary case” in
order to measure the crime’s risk. The Government explic-
itly acknowledges that point here. See Brief for Petitioner
11 (“Section 16(b), like [ACCA’s] residual clause, requires
a court to assess the risk posed by the ordinary case of a
particular offense”). And indeed, the Government’s brief-
ing in Johnson warned us about that likeness, observing
that §16(b) would be “equally susceptible to [an] objection”
that focused on the problems of positing a crime’s ordinary
case. Supp. Brief for Respondent, O. T. 2014, No. 13–
7120, pp. 22–23. Nothing in §16(b) helps courts to perform
that task, just as nothing in ACCA did. We can as well
repeat here what we asked in Johnson: How does one go
about divining the conduct entailed in a crime’s ordinary
case? Statistical analyses? Surveys? Experts? Google?
Gut instinct? See Johnson, 576 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at
5); supra, at 7; post, at 16–17 (GORSUCH, J., concurring in
——————
  3 Johnson  also anticipated and rejected a significant aspect of JUSTICE
THOMAS’s dissent in this case. According to JUSTICE THOMAS, a court
may not invalidate a statute for vagueness if it is clear in any of its
applications—as he thinks is true of completed burglary, which is the
offense Dimaya committed. See post, at 16–20. But as an initial
matter, Johnson explained that supposedly easy applications of the
residual clause might not be “so easy after all.” 576 U. S., at ___–___
(slip op., at 10–11). The crime of completed burglary at issue here
illustrates that point forcefully. See id., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (asking
whether “an ordinary burglar invade[s] an occupied home by night or
an unoccupied home by day”); Dimaya v. Lynch, 803 F. 3d 1110, 1116,
n. 7 (CA9 2015) (noting that only about seven percent of burglaries
actually involve violence); Cal. Penal Code Ann. §§459, 460 (West 2010)
(sweeping so broadly as to cover even dishonest door-to-door salesmen).
And still more fundamentally, Johnson made clear that our decisions
“squarely contradict the theory that a vague provision is constitutional
merely because there is some conduct that clearly falls within the
provision’s grasp.” 576 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11).
10                      SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                          Opinion of the Court

part and concurring in judgment). And we can as well
reiterate Johnson’s example: In the ordinary case of at-
tempted burglary, is the would-be culprit spotted and
confronted, or scared off by a yell? See post, at 16 (opinion
of GORSUCH, J.) (offering other knotty examples). Once
again, the questions have no good answers; the “ordinary
case” remains, as Johnson described it, an excessively
“speculative,” essentially inscrutable thing. 576 U. S.,
at ___ (slip op., at 5); accord post, at 27 (THOMAS, J.,
dissenting).4
   And §16(b) also possesses the second fatal feature of
ACCA’s residual clause: uncertainty about the level of risk
that makes a crime “violent.” In ACCA, that threshold
was “serious potential risk”; in §16(b), it is “substantial
risk.” See supra, at 2, 4. But the Government does not
argue that the latter formulation is any more determinate
than the former, and for good reason. As THE CHIEF
JUSTICE’s valiant attempt to do so shows, that would be
slicing the baloney mighty thin. See post, at 5–6 (dissent-
ing opinion). And indeed, Johnson as much as equated the
two phrases: Return to the block quote above, and note
how Johnson—as though anticipating this case—refers to
them interchangeably, as alike examples of imprecise
“qualitative standard[s].” See supra, at 8; 576 U. S., at ___
(slip op., at 12). Once again, the point is not that such a
non-numeric standard is alone problematic: In Johnson’s
words, “we do not doubt” the constitutionality of applying

——————
  4 THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s dissent makes light of the difficulty of identify-

ing a crime’s ordinary case. In a single footnote, THE CHIEF JUSTICE
portrays that task as no big deal: Just eliminate the “atypical” cases,
and (presto!) the crime’s nature and risk are revealed. See post, at 5,
n. 1. That rosy view—at complete odds with Johnson—underlies his
whole dissent (and especially, his analysis of how §16(b) applies to
particular offenses, see post, at 7–10). In effect, THE CHIEF JUSTICE is
able to conclude that §16(b) can survive Johnson only by refusing to
acknowledge one of the two core insights of that decision.

§16(b)’s “substantial risk [standard] to real-world con-
duct.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (internal quotation marks
omitted). The difficulty comes, in §16’s residual clause
just as in ACCA’s, from applying such a standard to “a
judge-imagined abstraction”—i.e., “an idealized ordinary
case of the crime.” Id., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 6, 12). It is
then that the standard ceases to work in a way consistent
with due process.
   In sum, §16(b) has the same “[t]wo features” that “con-
spire[d] to make [ACCA’s residual clause] unconstitution-
ally vague.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 5). It too “requires a
court to picture the kind of conduct that the crime involves
in ‘the ordinary case,’ and to judge whether that abstrac-
tion presents” some not-well-specified-yet-sufficiently-
large degree of risk. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 4). The result
is that §16(b) produces, just as ACCA’s residual clause did,
“more unpredictability and arbitrariness than the Due
Process Clause tolerates.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6).
                             IV
  The Government and dissents offer two fundamentally
different accounts of how §16(b) can escape unscathed
from our decision in Johnson. JUSTICE THOMAS accepts
that the ordinary-case inquiry makes §16(b) “impossible to
apply.” Post, at 27. His solution is to overthrow our his-
toric understanding of the statute: We should now read
§16(b), he says, to ask about the risk posed by a particular
defendant’s particular conduct. In contrast, the Govern-
ment, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, accepts that §16(b),
as long interpreted, demands a categorical approach,
rather than a case-specific one. They argue only that
“distinctive textual features” of §16’s residual clause make
applying it “more predictable” than its ACCA counter-
part. Brief for Petitioner 28, 29. We disagree with both
arguments.

                                A
  The essentials of JUSTICE THOMAS’s position go as fol-
lows. Section 16(b), he says, cannot have one meaning,
but could have one of two others. See post, at 27. The
provision cannot demand an inquiry merely into the ele-
ments of a crime, because that is the province of §16(a).
See supra, at 2 (setting out §16(a)’s text). But that still
leaves a pair of options: the categorical, ordinary-case
approach and the “underlying-conduct approach,” which
asks about the specific way in which a defendant commit-
ted a crime. Post, at 25. According to JUSTICE THOMAS,
each option is textually viable (although he gives a slight
nod to the latter based on §16(b)’s use of the word “in-
volves”). See post, at 24–26. What tips the scales is that
only one—the conduct approach—is at all “workable.”
Post, at 27. The difficulties of the ordinary-case inquiry,
JUSTICE THOMAS rightly observes, underlie this Court’s
view that §16(b) is too vague. So abandon that inquiry,
JUSTICE THOMAS urges. After all, he reasons, it is the
Court’s “plain duty,” under the constitutional avoidance
canon, to adopt any reasonable construction of a statute
that escapes constitutional problems. Post, at 28–29
(quoting United States ex rel. Attorney General v. Dela-
ware & Hudson Co., 213 U. S. 366, 407 (1909)).
  For anyone who has read Johnson, that argument will
ring a bell. The dissent there issued the same invitation,
based on much the same reasoning, to jettison the categor-
ical approach in residual-clause cases. 576 U. S., at ___–
___ (slip op., at 9–13) (opinion of ALITO, J.). The Court
declined to do so. It first noted that the Government had
not asked us to switch to a fact-based inquiry. It then
observed that the Court “had good reasons” for originally
adopting the categorical approach, based partly on ACCA’s
text (which, by the way, uses the word “involves” identi-
cally) and partly on the “utter impracticability” of the alter-
native. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (majority opinion). “The

only plausible interpretation” of ACCA’s residual clause,
we concluded, “requires use of the categorical approach”—
even if that approach could not in the end satisfy constitu-
tional standards. Ibid. (internal quotation marks and
alteration omitted).
   The same is true here—except more so. To begin where
Johnson did, the Government once again “has not asked
us to abandon the categorical approach in residual-clause
cases.” Ibid. To the contrary, and as already noted, the
Government has conceded at every step the correctness of
that statutory construction. See supra, at 9. And this
time, the Government’s decision is even more noteworthy
than before—precisely because the Johnson dissent laid
out the opposite view, presenting it in prepackaged form
for the Government to take off the shelf and use in the
§16(b) context. Of course, we are not foreclosed from going
down JUSTICE THOMAS’s path just because the Govern-
ment has not done so. But we find it significant that the
Government cannot bring itself to say that the fact-based
approach JUSTICE THOMAS proposes is a tenable interpre-
tation of §16’s residual clause.
   Perhaps one reason for the Government’s reluctance is
that such an approach would generate its own constitu-
tional questions. As JUSTICE THOMAS relates, post, at 22,
28, this Court adopted the categorical approach in part to
“avoid[ ] the Sixth Amendment concerns that would arise
from sentencing courts’ making findings of fact that
properly belong to juries.” Descamps v. United States, 570
U. S. 254, 267 (2013). JUSTICE THOMAS thinks that issue
need not detain us here because “the right of trial by jury
ha[s] no application in a removal proceeding.” Post, at 28
(internal quotation marks omitted). But although this
particular case involves removal, §16(b) is a criminal
statute, with criminal sentencing consequences.         See
supra, at 2. And this Court has held (it could hardly have
done otherwise) that “we must interpret the statute con-
14                  SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

sistently, whether we encounter its application in a crimi-
nal or noncriminal context.” Leocal, 543 U. S., at 12, n. 8.
So JUSTICE THOMAS’s suggestion would merely ping-pong
us from one constitutional issue to another. And that
means the avoidance canon cannot serve, as he would like,
as the interpretive tie breaker.
   In any event, §16(b)’s text creates no draw: Best read, it
demands a categorical approach. Our decisions have
consistently understood language in the residual clauses
of both ACCA and §16 to refer to “the statute of conviction,
not to the facts of each defendant’s conduct.” Taylor v.
United States, 495 U. S. 575, 601 (1990); see Leocal, 543
U. S., at 7 (Section 16 “directs our focus to the ‘offense’ of
conviction . . . rather than to the particular facts”). Simple
references to a “conviction,” “felony,” or “offense,” we have
stated, are “read naturally” to denote the “crime as gener-
ally committed.” Nijhawan v. Holder, 557 U. S. 29, 34
(2009); see Leocal, 543 U. S., at 7; Johnson, 576 U. S., at
___ (slip op., at 13). And the words “by its nature” in
§16(b) make that meaning all the clearer. The statute,
recall, directs courts to consider whether an offense, by its
nature, poses the requisite risk of force. An offense’s
“nature” means its “normal and characteristic quality.”
Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 1507
(2002). So §16(b) tells courts to figure out what an offense
normally—or, as we have repeatedly said, “ordinarily”—
entails, not what happened to occur on one occasion. And
the same conclusion follows if we pay attention to lan-
guage that is missing from §16(b). As we have observed in
the ACCA context, the absence of terms alluding to a
crime’s circumstances, or its commission, makes a fact-
based interpretation an uncomfortable fit. See Descamps,
570 U. S., at 267. If Congress had wanted judges to look
into a felon’s actual conduct, “it presumably would have
said so; other statutes, in other contexts, speak in just that

way.” Id., at 267–268.5 The upshot of all this textual
evidence is that §16’s residual clause—like ACCA’s, except
still more plainly—has no “plausible” fact-based reading.
Johnson, 576 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13).
   And finally, the “utter impracticability”—and associated
inequities—of such an interpretation is as great in the one
statute as in the other. Ibid. This Court has often de-
scribed the daunting difficulties of accurately “recon-
struct[ing],” often many years later, “the conduct underly-
ing [a] conviction.” Ibid.; Descamps, 570 U. S., at 270;
Taylor, 495 U. S., at 601–602. According to JUSTICE
THOMAS, we need not worry here because immigration
judges have some special factfinding talent, or at least
experience, that would mitigate the risk of error attaching
to that endeavor in federal courts. See post, at 30. But we
cannot see putting so much weight on the superior fact-
finding prowess of (notoriously overburdened) immigration
judges. And as we have said before, §16(b) is a criminal
statute with applications outside the immigration context.
See supra, at 2, 13. Once again, then, we have no ground
for discovering a novel interpretation of §16(b) that would
remove us from the dictates of Johnson.

——————
  5 For example, in United States v. Hayes, 555 U. S. 415 (2009), this
Court held that a firearms statute referring to former crimes as “com-
mitted by” specified persons requires courts to consider underlying
facts. Id., at 421. And in Nijhawan v. Holder, 557 U. S. 29 (2009), the
Court similarly adopted a non-categorical interpretation of one of the
aggravated felonies listed in the INA because of the phrase, appended
to the named offense, “in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds
$10,000.” Id., at 34, 36 (emphasis deleted). JUSTICE THOMAS suggests
that Nijhawan rejected the relevance of our ACCA precedents in
interpreting the INA’s aggravated-felony list—including its incorpora-
tion of §16(b). Post, at 29–30. But that misreads the decision. In
Nijhawan, we considered an item on the INA’s list that looks nothing
like ACCA, and we concluded—no surprise here—that our ACCA
decisions did not offer a useful guide. As to items on the INA’s list that
do mirror ACCA, the opposite conclusion of course follows.
16                 SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                     Opinion of the Court 


                            B

  Agreeing that is so, the Government (joined by THE
CHIEF JUSTICE) takes a narrower path to the same desired
result. It points to three textual discrepancies between
ACCA’s residual clause and §16(b), and argues that they
make §16(b) significantly easier to apply. But each turns
out to be the proverbial distinction without a difference.
None relates to the pair of features—the ordinary-case
inquiry and a hazy risk threshold—that Johnson found to
produce impermissible vagueness. And none otherwise
affects the determinacy of the statutory inquiry into
whether a prior conviction is for a violent crime. That is
why, contrary to the Government’s final argument, the
experience of applying both statutes has generated confu-
sion and division among lower courts.
                              1
  The Government first—and foremost—relies on §16(b)’s
express requirement (absent from ACCA) that the risk
arise from acts taken “in the course of committing the
offense.” Brief for Petitioner 31. (THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s
dissent echoes much of this argument. See post, at 6–7.)
Because of that “temporal restriction,” a court applying
§16(b) may not “consider risks arising after” the offense’s
commission is over. Ibid. In the Government’s view,
§16(b)’s text thereby demands a “significantly more fo-
cused inquiry” than did ACCA’s residual clause. Id., at 32.
  To assess that claim, start with the meaning of §16(b)’s
“in the course of ” language. That phrase, understood in
the normal way, includes the conduct occurring through-
out a crime’s commission—not just the conduct sufficient
to satisfy the offense’s formal elements. The Government
agrees with that construction, explaining that the words
“in the course of ” sweep in everything that happens while
a crime continues. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 57–58 (Oct. 2,
2017) (illustrating that idea with reference to conspiracy,
                   Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)             17

                       Opinion of the Court

burglary, kidnapping, and escape from prison). So, for
example, conspiracy may be a crime of violence under
§16(b) because of the risk of force while the conspiracy is
ongoing (i.e., “in the course of ” the conspiracy); it is irrele-
vant that conspiracy’s elements are met as soon as the
participants have made an agreement. See ibid.; United
States v. Doe, 49 F. 3d 859, 866 (CA2 1995). Similarly,
and closer to home, burglary may be a crime of violence
under §16(b) because of the prospects of an encounter
while the burglar remains in a building (i.e., “in the course
of ” the burglary); it does not matter that the elements of
the crime are met at the precise moment of his entry. See
Tr. of Oral Arg. 57–58 (Oct. 2, 2017); James, 550 U. S., at
203. In other words, a court applying §16(b) gets to con-
sider everything that is likely to take place for as long as a
crime is being committed.
   Because that is so, §16(b)’s “in the course of ” language
does little to narrow or focus the statutory inquiry. All
that the phrase excludes is a court’s ability to consider the
risk that force will be used after the crime has entirely
concluded—so, for example, after the conspiracy has dis-
solved or the burglar has left the building. We can con-
struct law-school-type hypotheticals fitting that fact pat-
tern—say, a burglar who constructs a booby trap that
later knocks out the homeowner. But such imaginative
forays cannot realistically affect a court’s view of the
ordinary case of a crime, which is all that matters under
the statute. See supra, at 2–3, 7. In the ordinary case, the
riskiness of a crime arises from events occurring during its
commission, not events occurring later. So with or with-
out §16(b)’s explicit temporal language, a court applying
the section would do the same thing—ask what usually
happens when a crime goes down.
   And that is just what courts did when applying ACCA’s
residual clause—and for the same reason. True, that
clause lacked an express temporal limit. But not a single
18                      SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                          Opinion of the Court

one of this Court’s ACCA decisions turned on conduct that
might occur after a crime’s commission; instead, each
hinged on the risk arising from events that could happen
while the crime was ongoing. See, e.g., Sykes v. United
States, 564 U. S. 1, 10 (2011) (assessing the risks attached
to the “confrontations that initiate and terminate” vehicle
flight, along with “intervening” events); Chambers v.
United States, 555 U. S. 122, 128 (2009) (rejecting the
Government’s argument that violent incidents “occur[ring]
long after” a person unlawfully failed to report to prison
rendered that crime a violent felony). Nor could those
decisions have done otherwise, given the statute’s concern
with the ordinary (rather than the outlandish) case. Once
again, the riskiness of a crime in the ordinary case de-
pends on the acts taken during—not after—its commis-
sion. Thus, the analyses under ACCA’s residual clause
and §16(b) coincide.
   The upshot is that the phrase “in the course of ” makes
no difference as to either outcome or clarity. Every offense
that could have fallen within ACCA’s residual clause
might equally fall within §16(b). And the difficulty of
deciding whether it does so remains just as intractable.
Indeed, we cannot think of a single federal crime whose
treatment becomes more obvious under §16(b) than under
ACCA because of the words “in the course of.”6 The
——————
  6 In response to repeated questioning at two oral arguments, the Gov-

ernment proposed one (and only one) such crime—but we disagree that
§16(b)’s temporal language would aid in its analysis. According to the
Government, possession of a short-barreled shotgun could count as
violent under ACCA but not under §16(b) because shooting the gun is
“not in the course of committing the crime of possession.” Tr. of Oral
Arg. 59–60 (Oct. 2, 2017); see Tr. of Oral Arg. 6–7 (Jan. 17, 2017); Brief
for Petitioner 32–34. That is just wrong: When a criminal shoots a gun,
he does so while (“in the course of ”) possessing it (except perhaps in
some physics-defying fantasy world). What makes the offense difficult
to classify as violent is something different: that while some people use
the short-barreled shotguns they possess to commit murder, others

                          Opinion of the Court

phrase, then, cannot cure the statutory indeterminacy
Johnson described.
   Second, the Government (and again, THE CHIEF
JUSTICE’s dissent, see post, at 6) observes that §16(b)
focuses on the risk of “physical force” whereas ACCA’s
residual clause asked about the risk of “physical injury.”
The §16(b) inquiry, the Government says, “trains solely”
on the conduct typically involved in a crime. Brief for
Petitioner 36. By contrast, the Government continues,
ACCA’s residual clause required a second inquiry: After
describing the ordinary criminal’s conduct, a court had to
“speculate about a chain of causation that could possibly
result in a victim’s injury.” Ibid. The Government’s con-
clusion is that the §16(b) inquiry is “more specific.” Ibid.
   But once more, we struggle to see how that statutory
distinction would matter. To begin with, the first of the
Government’s two steps—defining the conduct in the
ordinary case—is almost always the difficult part. Once
that is accomplished, the assessment of consequences
tends to follow as a matter of course. So, for example, if a
crime is likely enough to lead to a shooting, it will also be
likely enough to lead to an injury. And still more im-
portant, §16(b) involves two steps as well—and essentially
the same ones. In interpreting statutes like §16(b), this
Court has made clear that “physical force” means “force

merely store them in a nearby firearms cabinet—and it is hard to settle
which is the more likely scenario. Compare Johnson, 576 U. S., at ___–
___ (slip op., at 19–20) (ALITO, J., dissenting) (“It is fanciful to assume
that a person who [unlawfully possesses] a notoriously dangerous
weapon is unlikely to use that weapon in violent ways”), with id., at ___
(slip op., at 4) (THOMAS, J., concurring) (Unlawful possession of a short-
barreled shotgun “takes place in a variety of ways . . . many, perhaps
most, of which do not involve likely accompanying violence” (internal
quotation marks omitted)). But contrary to THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s
suggestion, see post, at 7–8 (which, again, is tied to his disregard of the
ordinary-case inquiry, see supra, at 10, n. 4), that issue must be settled
no less under §16(b) than under ACCA.
20                   SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                      Opinion of the Court

capable of causing physical pain or injury.” Johnson v.
United States, 559 U. S. 133, 140 (2010) (defining the term
for purposes of deciding what counts as a “violent” crime).
So under §16(b) too, a court must not only identify the
conduct typically involved in a crime, but also gauge its
potential consequences. Or said a bit differently, evaluat-
ing the risk of “physical force” itself entails considering the
risk of “physical injury.”         For those reasons, the
force/injury distinction is unlikely to affect a court’s analy-
sis of whether a crime qualifies as violent. All the same
crimes might—or, then again, might not—satisfy both
requirements.      Accordingly, this variance in wording
cannot make ACCA’s residual clause vague and §16(b) not.
   Third, the Government briefly notes that §16(b), unlike
ACCA’s residual clause, is not preceded by a “confusing
list of exemplar crimes.” Brief for Petitioner 38. (THE
CHIEF JUSTICE’s dissent reiterates this argument, with
some additional references to our caselaw. See post, at
10–12.) Here, the Government is referring to the offenses
ACCA designated as violent felonies independently of the
residual clause (i.e., burglary, arson, extortion, and use of
explosives). See supra, at 4. According to the Govern-
ment, those crimes provided “contradictory and opaque
indications” of what non-specified offenses should also
count as violent. Brief for Petitioner 38. Because §16(b)
lacks any such enumerated crimes, the Government con-
cludes, it avoids the vagueness of ACCA’s residual clause.
   We readily accept a part of that argument. This Court
for several years looked to ACCA’s listed crimes for help in
giving the residual clause meaning. See, e.g., Begay v.
United States, 553 U. S. 137, 142 (2008); James, 550 U. S.,
at 203. But to no avail. As the Government relates (and
Johnson explained), the enumerated crimes were them-
selves too varied to provide such assistance. See Brief for
Petitioner 38–40; 576 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12). Trying
to reconcile them with each other, and then compare them
                  Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)           21

                      Opinion of the Court

to whatever unlisted crime was at issue, drove many a
judge a little batty. And more to the point, the endeavor
failed to bring any certainty to the residual clause’s appli-
cation. See Brief for Petitioner 38–40.
  But the Government’s conclusion does not follow. To
say that ACCA’s listed crimes failed to resolve the residual
clause’s vagueness is hardly to say they caused the prob-
lem. Had they done so, Johnson would not have needed to
strike down the clause. It could simply have instructed
courts to give up on trying to interpret the clause by refer-
ence to the enumerated offenses. (Contrary to THE CHIEF
JUSTICE’s suggestion, see post, at 12, discarding an inter-
pretive tool once it is found not to actually aid in interpre-
tation hardly “expand[s]” the scope of a statute.) That
Johnson went so much further—invalidating a statutory
provision rather than construing it independently of an-
other—demonstrates that the list of crimes was not the
culprit. And indeed, Johnson explicitly said as much. As
described earlier, Johnson found the residual clause’s
vagueness to reside in just “two” of its features: the
ordinary-case requirement and a fuzzy risk standard. See
576 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 5–6); supra, at 7–8.
Strip away the enumerated crimes—as Congress did in
§16(b)—and those dual flaws yet remain. And ditto the
textual indeterminacy that flows from them.
                             2
  Faced with the two clauses’ linguistic similarity, the
Government relies significantly on an argument rooted in
judicial experience. Our opinion in Johnson, the Govern-
ment notes, spoke of the longstanding “trouble” that this
Court and others had in “making sense of [ACCA’s] resid-
ual clause.” 576 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9); see Brief for
Petitioner 45. According to the Government, §16(b) has
not produced “comparable difficulties.” Id., at 46. Lower
courts, the Government claims, have divided less often
22                      SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                          Opinion of the Court

about the provision’s meaning, and as a result this Court
granted certiorari on “only a single Section 16(b) case”
before this one. Ibid.7 “The most likely explanation,” the
Government concludes, is that “Section 16(b) is clearer”
than its ACCA counterpart. Id., at 47.
   But in fact, a host of issues respecting §16(b)’s applica-
tion to specific crimes divide the federal appellate courts.
Does car burglary qualify as a violent felony under §16(b)?
Some courts say yes, another says no.8 What of statutory
rape? Once again, the Circuits part ways.9 How about
evading arrest? The decisions point in different direc-
tions.10 Residential trespass? The same is true.11 Those
examples do not exhaust the current catalogue of Circuit
conflicts concerning §16(b)’s application. See Brief for
——————
  7 And,  THE CHIEF JUSTICE emphasizes, we decided that one unani-
mously! See post, at 3 (discussing Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1
(2004)). But one simple application does not a clear statute make. As
we put the point in Johnson: Our decisions “squarely contradict the
theory that a vague provision is constitutional merely because there is
some conduct that clearly falls within the provision’s grasp.” 576 U. S.,
at ___ (slip op., at 11); see supra, at 9, n. 4.

National Immigration Project of the National Lawyers
Guild et al. as Amici Curiae 7–18 (citing divided appellate
decisions as to the unauthorized use of a vehicle, firearms
possession, and abduction). And that roster would just
expand with time, mainly because, as Johnson explained,
precious few crimes (of the thousands that fill the statute
books) have an obvious, non-speculative—and therefore
undisputed—“ordinary case.” See 576 U. S., at ___–___
(slip op., at 5–6).
   Nor does this Court’s prior handling of §16(b) cases
support the Government’s argument. To be sure, we have
heard oral argument in only two cases arising from §16(b)
(including this one), as compared with five involving
ACCA’s residual clause (including Johnson).12 But while
some of those ACCA suits were pending before us, we
received a number of petitions for certiorari presenting
related issues in the §16(b) context. And after issuing the
relevant ACCA decisions, we vacated the judgments in
those §16(b) cases and remanded them for further consid-
eration.13 That we disposed of the ACCA and §16(b) peti-
——————
  12 From    all we can tell—and all the Government has told us, see Brief
for Petitioner 45–52—lower courts have also decided many fewer cases
involving §16(b) than ACCA’s residual clause. That disparity likely
reflects the Government’s lesser need to rely on §16(b). That provision
is mainly employed (as here) in the immigration context, to establish an
“aggravated felony” requiring deportation. See supra, at 2. But immi-
gration law offers many other ways to achieve that result. The INA
lists 80 or so crimes that count as aggravated felonies; only if a convic-
tion is not for one of those specified offenses need the Government
resort to §16(b) (or another catch-all provision). See Luna Torres v.
Lynch, 578 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 2). By contrast, ACCA
enumerates only four crimes as a basis for enhancing sentences; the
Government therefore had reason to use the statute’s residual clause
more often.

tions in that order, rather than its opposite, provides no
reason to disregard the indeterminacy that §16(b) shares
with ACCA’s residual clause.
   And of course, this Court’s experience in deciding ACCA
cases only supports the conclusion that §16(b) is too vague.
For that record reveals that a statute with all the same
hallmarks as §16(b) could not be applied with the predict-
ability the Constitution demands. See id., at ___–___ (slip
op., at 6–9); supra, at 6–9. The Government would con-
demn us to repeat the past—to rerun the old ACCA tape,
as though we remembered nothing from its first showing.
But why should we disregard a lesson so hard learned?
“Insanity,” Justice Scalia wrote in the last ACCA residual
clause case before Johnson, “is doing the same thing over
and over again, but expecting different results.” Sykes,
564 U. S., at 28 (dissenting opinion). We abandoned that
lunatic practice in Johnson and see no reason to start it
again.
                               V
   Johnson tells us how to resolve this case. That decision
held that “[t]wo features of [ACCA’s] residual clause con-
spire[d] to make it unconstitutionally vague.” 576 U. S.,
at ___ (slip op., at 5). Because the clause had both an
ordinary-case requirement and an ill-defined risk thresh-
old, it necessarily “devolv[ed] into guesswork and intui-
tion,” invited arbitrary enforcement, and failed to provide
fair notice. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 8). Section 16(b) pos-
sesses the exact same two features. And none of the minor
linguistic disparities in the statutes makes any real differ-
ence. So just like ACCA’s residual clause, §16(b) “produc-
es more unpredictability and arbitrariness than the Due
Process Clause tolerates.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6). We

JEFFERSON B. SESSIONS, III, ATTORNEY GENERAL,
     PETITIONER v. JAMES GARCIA DIMAYA
 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

                     [April 17, 2018] 


   JUSTICE GORSUCH, concurring in part and concurring in
the judgment.
   Vague laws invite arbitrary power. Before the Revolu­
tion, the crime of treason in English law was so capa­
ciously construed that the mere expression of disfavored
opinions could invite transportation or death. The founders
cited the crown’s abuse of “pretended” crimes like this as
one of their reasons for revolution. See Declaration of
Independence ¶21. Today’s vague laws may not be as
invidious, but they can invite the exercise of arbitrary
power all the same—by leaving the people in the dark
about what the law demands and allowing prosecutors and
courts to make it up.
   The law before us today is such a law. Before holding a
lawful permanent resident alien like James Dimaya sub­
ject to removal for having committed a crime, the Immi­
gration and Nationality Act requires a judge to determine
that the ordinary case of the alien’s crime of conviction
involves a substantial risk that physical force may be
used. But what does that mean? Just take the crime at
issue in this case, California burglary, which applies to
everyone from armed home intruders to door-to-door
salesmen peddling shady products. How, on that vast
spectrum, is anyone supposed to locate the ordinary case
and say whether it includes a substantial risk of physical
force? The truth is, no one knows. The law’s silence
2                   SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                    Opinion of GORSUCH, J.

leaves judges to their intuitions and the people to their
fate. In my judgment, the Constitution demands more.
                              *
   I begin with a foundational question. Writing for the
Court in Johnson v. United States, 576 U. S. ___ (2015),
Justice Scalia held the residual clause of the Armed Ca­
reer Criminal Act void for vagueness because it invited
“more unpredictability and arbitrariness” than the Consti­
tution allows. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6). Because the
residual clause in the statute now before us uses almost
exactly the same language as the residual clause in John-
son, respect for precedent alone would seem to suggest
that both clauses should suffer the same judgment.
   But first in Johnson and now again today JUSTICE
THOMAS has questioned whether our vagueness doctrine
can fairly claim roots in the Constitution as originally
understood. See, e.g., post, at 2–6 (dissenting opinion);
Johnson, supra, at ___–___ (opinion concurring in judg­
ment) (slip op., at 6–18). For its part, the Court has yet to
offer a reply. I believe our colleague’s challenge is a seri­
ous and thoughtful one that merits careful attention. At
day’s end, though, it is a challenge to which I find my-
self unable to subscribe. Respectfully, I am persuaded in-
stead that void for vagueness doctrine, at least properly
conceived, serves as a faithful expression of ancient due
process and separation of powers principles the
framers recognized as vital to ordered liberty under our
Constitution.
   Consider first the doctrine’s due process underpinnings.
The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments guarantee that
“life, liberty, or property” may not be taken “without due
process of law.” That means the government generally
may not deprive a person of those rights without affording
him the benefit of (at least) those “customary procedures
to which freemen were entitled by the old law of England.”

                    Opinion of GORSUCH, J.

Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499 U. S. 1, 28 (1991)
(Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (internal quotation
marks omitted). Admittedly, some have suggested that
the Due Process Clause does less work than this, allowing
the government to deprive people of their liberty through
whatever procedures (or lack of them) the government’s
current laws may tolerate. Post, at 3, n. 1 (opinion of
THOMAS, J.) (collecting authorities). But in my view the
weight of the historical evidence shows that the clause
sought to ensure that the people’s rights are never any
less secure against governmental invasion than they were
at common law. Lord Coke took this view of the English
due process guarantee. 1 E. Coke, The Second Part of the
Institutes of the Laws of England 50 (1797). John
Rutledge, our second Chief Justice, explained that Coke’s
teachings were carefully studied and widely adopted by
the framers, becoming “ ‘almost the foundations of our
law.’ ” Klopfer v. North Carolina, 386 U. S. 213, 225
(1967). And many more students of the Constitution
besides—from Justice Story to Justice Scalia—have
agreed that this view best represents the original under­
standing of our own Due Process Clause. See, e.g., Mur-
ray’s Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co., 18 How.
272, 277 (1856); 3 J. Story, Commentaries on the Consti­
tution of the United States §1783, p. 661 (1833); Pacific
Mut., supra, at 28–29 (opinion of Scalia, J.); Eberle, Proce­
dural Due Process: The Original Understanding, 4 Const.
Comment. 339, 341 (1987).
  Perhaps the most basic of due process’s customary
protections is the demand of fair notice. See Connally v.
General Constr. Co., 269 U. S. 385, 391 (1926); see also
Note, Textualism as Fair Notice, 123 Harv. L. Rev. 542,
543 (2009) (“From the inception of Western culture, fair
notice has been recognized as an essential element of the
rule of law”). Criminal indictments at common law had to
provide “precise and sufficient certainty” about the charges
4                   SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                    Opinion of GORSUCH, J.

involved. 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws
of England 301 (1769) (Blackstone). Unless an “offence
[was] set forth with clearness and certainty,” the indict­
ment risked being held void in court. Id., at 302 (empha­
sis deleted); 2 W. Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown, ch. 25,
§§99, 100, pp. 244–245 (2d ed. 1726) (“[I]t seems to have
been anciently the common practice, where an indictment
appeared to be [in]sufficient, either for its uncertainty or
the want of proper legal words, not to put the defendant to
answer it”).
   The same held true in civil cases affecting a person’s
life, liberty, or property. A civil suit began by obtaining a
writ—a detailed and specific form of action asking for
particular relief. Bellia, Article III and the Cause of Ac­
tion, 89 Iowa L. Rev. 777, 784–786 (2004); Subrin, How
Equity Conquered Common Law: The Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure in Historical Perspective, 135 U. Pa. L.
Rev. 909, 914–915 (1987). Because the various civil writs
were clearly defined, English subjects served with one
would know with particularity what legal requirement
they were alleged to have violated and, accordingly, what
would be at issue in court. Id., at 917; Moffitt, Pleadings
in the Age of Settlement, 80 Ind. L. J. 727, 731 (2005).
And a writ risked being held defective if it didn’t provide
fair notice. Goldington v. Bassingburn, Y. B. Trin. 3 Edw.
II, f. 27b (1310) (explaining that it was “the law of the
land” that “no one [could] be taken by surprise” by having
to “answer in court for what [one] has not been warned to
answer”).
   The requirement of fair notice applied to statutes too.
Blackstone illustrated the point with a case involving a
statute that made “stealing sheep, or other cattle” a fel-
ony. 1 Blackstone 88 (emphasis deleted). Because the term
“cattle” embraced a good deal more then than it does now
(including wild animals, no less), the court held the stat­
ute failed to provide adequate notice about what it did and

                         Opinion of GORSUCH, J.

did not cover—and so the court treated the term “cattle” as
a nullity. Ibid. All of which, Blackstone added, had the
salutary effect of inducing the legislature to reenter the
field and make itself clear by passing a new law extending
the statute to “bulls, cows, oxen,” and more “by name.”
Ibid.
   This tradition of courts refusing to apply vague statutes
finds parallels in early American practice as well. In The
Enterprise, 8 F. Cas. 732 (No. 4,499) (CC NY 1810), for
example, Justice Livingston found that a statute setting
the circumstances in which a ship may enter a port during
an embargo was too vague to be applied, concluding that
“the court had better pass” the statutory terms by “as
unintelligible and useless” rather than “put on them, at
great uncertainty, a very harsh signification, and one
which the legislature may never have designed.” Id., at
735. In United States v. Sharp, 27 F. Cas. 1041 (No.
16,264) (CC Pa. 1815), Justice Washington confronted a
statute which prohibited seamen from making a “revolt.”
Id., at 1043. But he was unable to determine the meaning
of this provision “by any authority . . . either in the com­
mon, admiralty, or civil law.” Ibid. As a result, he de­
clined to “recommend to the jury, to find the prisoners
guilty of making, or endeavouring to make a revolt, how­
ever strong the evidence may be.” Ibid.1
——————
   1 Many state courts also held vague laws ineffectual. See, e.g., State

v. Mann, 2 Ore. 238, 240–241 (1867) (holding statute that prohibited
“gambling devices” was “void” because “the term has no settled and
definite meaning”); Drake v. Drake, 15 N. C. 110, 115 (1833) (explaining
that “if the terms in which [a statute] is couched be so vague as to
convey no definite meaning to those whose duty it is to execute it . . . it
is necessarily inoperative”); McConvill v. Mayor and Aldermen of Jersey
City, 39 N. J. L. 38, 44 (1876) (holding that an ordinance was “bad for
vagueness and uncertainty in the thing forbidden”); State v. Boon, 1
N. C. 103, 105 (1801) (refusing to apply a statute because “no punish­
ment whatever can be inflicted; without using a discretion and indulg­
ing a latitude, which in criminal cases ought never to be allowed a

                        Opinion of GORSUCH, J.

  Nor was the concern with vague laws confined to the
most serious offenses like capital crimes. Courts refused
to apply vague laws in criminal cases involving relatively
modest penalties. See, e.g., McJunkins v. State, 10 Ind.
140, 145 (1858). They applied the doctrine in civil cases
too. See, e.g., Drake v. Drake, 15 N. C. 110, 115 (1833);
Commonwealth v. Bank of Pennsylvania, 3 Watts & Serg.
173, 177 (Pa. 1842). As one court put it, “all laws” “ought
to be expressed in such a manner as that its meaning may
be unambiguous, and in such language as may be readily
understood by those upon whom it is to operate.”
McConvill v. Mayor and Aldermen of Jersey City, 39
N. J. L. 38, 42 (1876). “ ‘It is impossible . . . to dissent from
the doctrine of Lord Coke, that acts of parliament ought to
be plainly and clearly, and not cunningly and darkly
penned, especially in penal matters.’ ” Id., at 42–43.
  These early cases, admittedly, often spoke in terms of
construing vague laws strictly rather than declaring them
void. See, e.g., post, at 4–5 (opinion of THOMAS, J.); John-
son, 576 U. S., at ___–___ (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (slip op.,
at 8–10). But in substance void the law is often exactly

prohibition on acts “injurious to the public morals” to be “vague” and
“simply null” (emphasis deleted)); McJunkins v. State, 10 Ind. 140, 145
(1858) (“It would therefore appear that the term public indecency has
no fixed legal meaning—is vague and indefinite, and cannot in itself
imply a definite offense”); Jennings v. State, 16 Ind. 335, 336 (1861)
(“We are of opinion that for want of a proper definition, no act is made
criminal by the terms ‘public indecency,’ employed in the statute”);

devoid of certainty” that “no valid election [could have] been held, and
that none can be held without further legislation”); Cheezem v. State, 2

kind whatever” and thus declaring it “a nullity”); see also Note, Statu­

                    Opinion of GORSUCH, J.

what these courts did: rather than try to construe or in­
terpret the statute before them, judges frequently held the
law simply too vague to apply. Blackstone, for example,
did not suggest the court in his illustration should have
given a narrowing construction to the term “cattle,” but
argued against giving it any effect at all. 1 Blackstone 88;
see also Scalia, Assorted Canards of Contemporary Legal
Analysis, 40 Case W. Res. L. Rev. 581, 582 (1989) (“I doubt
. . . that any modern court would go to the lengths de­
scribed by Blackstone in its application of the rule that
penal statutes are to be strictly construed”); Note, Indefi­
nite Criteria of Definiteness in Statutes, 45 Harv. L. Rev.
160, n. 3 (1931) (explaining that “since strict construction,
in effect, nullified ambiguous provisions, it was but a short
step to declaring them void ab initio”); supra, at 5, n. 1
(state courts holding vague statutory terms “void” or
“null”).
    What history suggests, the structure of the Constitution
confirms. Many of the Constitution’s other provisions
presuppose and depend on the existence of reasonably
clear laws. Take the Fourth Amendment’s requirement
that arrest warrants must be supported by probable cause,
and consider what would be left of that requirement if the
alleged crime had no meaningful boundaries. Or take the
Sixth Amendment’s mandate that a defendant must be
informed of the accusations against him and allowed to
bring witnesses in his defense, and consider what use
those rights would be if the charged crime was so vague
the defendant couldn’t tell what he’s alleged to have done
and what sort of witnesses he might need to rebut that
charge. Without an assurance that the laws supply fair
notice, so much else of the Constitution risks becoming
only a “parchment barrie[r]” against arbitrary power.
The Federalist No. 48, p. 308 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J.
Madison).
    Although today’s vagueness doctrine owes much to the
8                   SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                    Opinion of GORSUCH, J.

guarantee of fair notice embodied in the Due Process
Clause, it would be a mistake to overlook the doctrine’s
equal debt to the separation of powers. The Constitution
assigns “[a]ll legislative Powers” in our federal govern­
ment to Congress. Art. I, §1. It is for the people, through
their elected representatives, to choose the rules that will
govern their future conduct. See The Federalist No. 78, at
465 (A. Hamilton) (“The legislature . . . prescribes the
rules by which the duties and rights of every citizen are to
be regulated”). Meanwhile, the Constitution assigns to
judges the “judicial Power” to decide “Cases” and “Contro­
versies.” Art. III, §2. That power does not license judges
to craft new laws to govern future conduct, but only to
“discer[n] the course prescribed by law” as it currently
exists and to “follow it” in resolving disputes between the
people over past events. Osborn v. Bank of United States,
9 Wheat. 738, 866 (1824).
  From this division of duties, it comes clear that legisla­
tors may not “abdicate their responsibilities for setting the
standards of the criminal law,” Smith v. Goguen, 415 U. S.
566, 575 (1974), by leaving to judges the power to decide
“the various crimes includable in [a] vague phrase,” Jor-
dan v. De George, 341 U. S. 223, 242 (1951) (Jackson, J.,
dissenting). For “if the legislature could set a net large
enough to catch all possible offenders, and leave it to the
courts to step inside and say who could be rightfully de­
tained, and who should be set at large[,] [t]his would, to
some extent, substitute the judicial for the legislative
department of government.” Kolender v. Lawson, 461
U. S. 352, 358, n. 7 (1983) (internal quotation marks omit­
ted). Nor is the worry only that vague laws risk allowing
judges to assume legislative power. Vague laws also
threaten to transfer legislative power to police and prose­
cutors, leaving to them the job of shaping a vague statute’s
contours through their enforcement decisions.             See
Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104, 108–109 (1972)

                     Opinion of GORSUCH, J.

(“A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy mat­
ters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an
ad hoc and subjective basis”).
  These structural worries are more than just formal ones.
Under the Constitution, the adoption of new laws restrict­
ing liberty is supposed to be a hard business, the product
of an open and public debate among a large and diverse
number of elected representatives. Allowing the legisla­
ture to hand off the job of lawmaking risks substituting
this design for one where legislation is made easy, with a
mere handful of unelected judges and prosecutors free to
“condem[n] all that [they] personally disapprove and for no
better reason than [they] disapprove it.” Jordan, supra, at
242 (Jackson, J., dissenting). Nor do judges and prosecu­
tors act in the open and accountable forum of a legislature,
but in the comparatively obscure confines of cases and
controversies. See, e.g., A. Bickel, The Least Dangerous
Branch: The Supreme Court at the Bar of Politics 151
(1962) (“A vague statute delegates to administrators,
prosecutors, juries, and judges the authority of ad hoc
decision, which is in its nature difficult if not impossible to
hold to account, because of its narrow impact”). For just
these reasons, Hamilton warned, while “liberty can have
nothing to fear from the judiciary alone,” it has “every
thing to fear from” the union of the judicial and legislative
powers. The Federalist No. 78, at 466. No doubt, too, for
reasons like these this Court has held “that the more
important aspect of vagueness doctrine ‘is not actual
notice, but . . . the requirement that a legislature establish
minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement’ ” and keep
the separate branches within their proper spheres.
Kolender, supra, at 358 (quoting Goguen, supra, at 575
(emphasis added)).
                        *
  Persuaded that vagueness doctrine enjoys a secure

                    Opinion of GORSUCH, J.

footing in the original understanding of the Constitution,
the next question I confront concerns the standard of
review. What degree of imprecision should this Court
tolerate in a statute before declaring it unconstitutionally
vague? For its part, the government argues that where
(as here) a person faces only civil, not criminal, conse­
quences from a statute’s operation, we should declare the
law unconstitutional only if it is “unintelligible.” But in
the criminal context this Court has generally insisted that
the law must afford “ordinary people . . . fair notice of the
conduct it punishes.” Johnson, 576 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,
at 3). And I cannot see how the Due Process Clause might
often require any less than that in the civil context either.
Fair notice of the law’s demands, as we’ve seen, is “the
first essential of due process.” Connally, 269 U. S., at 391.
And as we’ve seen, too, the Constitution sought to pre­
serve a common law tradition that usually aimed to en­
sure fair notice before any deprivation of life, liberty, or
property could take place, whether under the banner of
the criminal or the civil law. See supra, at 2–7.
   First principles aside, the government suggests that at
least this Court’s precedents support adopting a less-than­
fair-notice standard for civil cases. But even that much I
do not see. This Court has already expressly held that a
“stringent vagueness test” should apply to at least some
civil laws—those abridging basic First Amendment free­
doms. Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc.,
455 U. S. 489, 499 (1982). This Court has made clear, too,
that due process protections against vague laws are “not to
be avoided by the simple label a State chooses to fasten
upon its conduct or its statute.” Giaccio v. Pennsylvania,
382 U. S. 399, 402 (1966). So the happenstance that a law
is found in the civil or criminal part of the statute books
cannot be dispositive. To be sure, this Court has also said
that what qualifies as fair notice depends “in part on the
nature of the enactment.” Hoffman Estates, 455 U. S., at
                 Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)          11

                    Opinion of GORSUCH, J.

498. And the Court has sometimes “expressed greater
tolerance of enactments with civil rather than criminal
penalties because the consequences of imprecision are
qualitatively less severe.” Id., at 498–499. But to
acknowledge these truisms does nothing to prove that civil
laws must always be subject to the government’s emaci­
ated form of review.
   In fact, if the severity of the consequences counts when
deciding the standard of review, shouldn’t we also take
account of the fact that today’s civil laws regularly impose
penalties far more severe than those found in many crimi­
nal statutes? Ours is a world filled with more and more
civil laws bearing more and more extravagant punish­
ments.      Today’s “civil” penalties include confiscatory
rather than compensatory fines, forfeiture provisions that
allow homes to be taken, remedies that strip persons of
their professional licenses and livelihoods, and the power
to commit persons against their will indefinitely. Some of
these penalties are routinely imposed and are routinely
graver than those associated with misdemeanor crimes—
and often harsher than the punishment for felonies. And
not only are “punitive civil sanctions . . . rapidly expand­
ing,” they are “sometimes more severely punitive than the
parallel criminal sanctions for the same conduct.” Mann,
Punitive Civil Sanctions: The Middleground Between
Criminal and Civil Law, 101 Yale L. J. 1795, 1798 (1992)
(emphasis added). Given all this, any suggestion that
criminal cases warrant a heightened standard of review
does more to persuade me that the criminal standard
should be set above our precedent’s current threshold than
to suggest the civil standard should be buried below it.
   Retreating to a more modest line of argument, the gov­
ernment emphasizes that this case arises in the immigra­
tion context and so implicates matters of foreign relations
where the Executive enjoys considerable constitutional
authority. But to acknowledge that the President has

broad authority to act in this general area supplies no
justification for allowing judges to give content to an im­
permissibly vague law.
   Alternatively still, JUSTICE THOMAS suggests that, at
least at the time of the founding, aliens present in this
country may not have been understood as possessing any
rights under the Due Process Clause. For support, he
points to the Alien Friends Act of 1798. An Act Concern­
ing Aliens §1, 1 Stat. 571; post, at 6–12 (opinion of
THOMAS, J.). But the Alien Friends Act—better known as
the “Alien” part of the Alien and Sedition Acts—is one of
the most notorious laws in our country’s history. It was
understood as a temporary war measure, not one that the
legislature would endorse in a time of tranquility. See,
e.g., Fehlings, Storm on the Constitution: The First Depor­
tation Law, 10 Tulsa J. Comp. & Int’l L. 63, 70–71 (2002).
Yet even then it was widely condemned as unconstitution­
al by Madison and many others. It also went unenforced,
may have cost the Federalist Party its existence, and
lapsed a mere two years after its enactment. With this
fuller view, it seems doubtful the Act tells us a great deal
about aliens’ due process rights at the founding.2

   2 See, e.g., Virginia Resolutions in 4 Debates on the Federal Constitu­

tion 528 (J. Elliot ed. 1836) (explaining that the Act, “by uniting legisla­
tive and judicial powers to those of executive, subverts . . . the particu­
lar organization, and positive provisions of the federal constitution”);
Madison’s Report on the Virginia Resolutions (Jan. 7, 1800) in 17
Papers of James Madison 318 (D. Mattern ed. 1991) (Madison’s Report)

American jurisprudence,” because “[t]he ground of suspicion is to be
judged of, not by any judicial authority, but by the executive magistrate
alone”); L. Canfield & H. Wilder, The Making of Modern America 158

ciated in the debates” over, among other things, the Alien Friends Act);

  Besides, none of this much matters. Whether Madison
or his adversaries had the better of the debate over the
constitutionality of the Alien Friends Act, Congress is
surely free to extend existing forms of liberty to new classes
of persons—liberty that the government may then take
only after affording due process. See, e.g., Sandin v. Con-
ner, 515 U. S. 472, 477–478 (1995); Easterbrook, Sub­
stance and Due Process, 1982 S. Ct. Rev. 85, 88 (“If . . . the
constitution, statute, or regulation creates a liberty or
property interest, then the second step—determining
‘what process is due’—comes into play”). Madison made
this very point, suggesting an alien’s admission in this
country could in some circumstances be analogous to “the
grant of land to an individual,” which “may be of favor not
of right; but the moment the grant is made, the favor
becomes a right, and must be forfeited before it can be
taken away.” Madison’s Report 319. And, of course, that’s
exactly what Congress eventually chose to do here. Dec­
ades ago, it enacted a law affording Mr. Dimaya lawful
permanent residency in this country, extending to him a
statutory liberty interest others traditionally have enjoyed

(2013) (“The Aliens Act and Sedition Act were met with widespread
criticism”); Lindsay, Immigration, Sovereignty, and the Constitution of
Foreignness, 45 Conn. L. Rev. 743, 759 (2013) (“[T]he [Alien Friends]
Act proved wildly unpopular among the American public, and contrib­
uted to the Republican electoral triumph in 1800 and the subsequent
demise of the Federalist Party”). Whether the law was unenforced or,
at most, enforced only once, the literature is not quite clear. Compare
Sidak, War, Liberty, and Enemy Aliens, 67 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 1402, 1406
(1992) (explaining the Act was never enforced); Cole, Enemy Aliens, 54

Detention in American Theory and Practice, 2 Harv. Nat’l Sec. J. 85,

(same); with Fehlings, Storm on the Constitution: The First Deporta­
tion Law, 10 Tulsa J. Comp. & Int’l L. 63, 109 (2002) (stating that the
Act was enforced once, on someone who was planning on leaving the
country in a few months anyway).

to remain in and move about the country free from physi­
cal imprisonment and restraint. See Dimaya v. Lynch,
803 F. 3d 1110, 1111 (CA9 2015); 8 U. S. C. §§1101(20),
1255. No one suggests Congress had to enact statutes of
this sort. And exactly what processes must attend the
deprivation of a statutorily afforded liberty interest like
this may pose serious and debatable questions. Cf. Mur-
ray’s Lessee, 18 How., at 277 (approving summary proce­
dures in another context). But however summary those
procedures might be, it’s hard to fathom why fair notice of
the law—the most venerable of due process’s require-
ments—would not be among them. Connally, 269 U. S., at
391.3

——————
  3 This Court already and long ago held that due process requires af­

fording aliens the “opportunity, at some time, to be heard” before some
lawful authority in advance of removal—and it’s unclear how that
opportunity might be meaningful without fair notice of the law’s
demands. The Japanese Immigrant Case, 189 U. S. 86, 101 (1903). Nor
do the cases JUSTICE THOMAS cites hold that a statutory right to lawful
permanent residency in this country can be withdrawn without due
process. Post, at 11 (dissenting opinion). Rather, each merely holds
that the particular statutory removal procedures under attack com­
ported with due process. See Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342 U. S. 580,
584–585 (1952) (rejecting argument that an “alien is entitled to consti­
tutional [due process] protection . . . to the same extent as the citizen”
before removal (emphasis added)); United States ex rel. Turner v.
Williams, 194 U. S. 279, 289–290 (1904) (deporting an alien found to be
in violation of a constitutionally valid law doesn’t violate due process);
Fong Yue Ting v. United States, 149 U. S. 698, 730 (1893) (deporting an
alien who hasn’t “complied with the conditions” required to stay in the
country doesn’t violate due process). Even when it came to judicially
unenforceable privileges in the past, “executive officials had to respect
statutory privileges that had been granted to private individuals and
that Congress had not authorized the officials to abrogate.” Nelson,
Adjudication in the Political Branches, 107 Colum. L. Rev. 559, 581
(2007) (emphasis deleted). So in a case like ours it would’ve been
incumbent on any executive official to determine that the alien commit­
ted a qualifying crime and statutory vagueness could pose a disabling
problem even there.

                     Opinion of GORSUCH, J.

   Today, a plurality of the Court agrees that we should
reject the government’s plea for a feeble standard of re­
view, but for a different reason. Ante, at 5–6. My col­
leagues suggest the law before us should be assessed
under the fair notice standard because of the special grav-
ity of its civil deportation penalty. But, grave as that
penalty may be, I cannot see why we would single it out
for special treatment when (again) so many civil laws
today impose so many similarly severe sanctions. Why,
for example, would due process require Congress to speak
more clearly when it seeks to deport a lawfully resident
alien than when it wishes to subject a citizen to indefinite
civil commitment, strip him of a business license essential
to his family’s living, or confiscate his home? I can think
of no good answer.
                               *
  With the fair notice standard now in hand, all that
remains is to ask how it applies to the case before us. And
here at least the answer comes readily for me: to the
extent it requires an “ordinary case” analysis, the portion
of the Immigration and Nationality Act before us fails the
fair notice test for the reasons Justice Scalia identified in
Johnson and the Court recounts today.
  Just like the statute in Johnson, the statute here in­
structs courts to impose special penalties on individuals
previously “convicted of” a “crime of violence.” 8 U. S. C.
§§1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), 1101(a)(43)(F). Just like the statute in
Johnson, the statute here fails to specify which crimes
qualify for that label. Instead, and again like the statute
in Johnson, the statute here seems to require a judge to
guess about the ordinary case of the crime of conviction
and then guess whether a “substantial risk” of “physical
force” attends its commission. 18 U. S. C. §16(b); Johnson,
576 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 4–5). Johnson held that
a law that asks so much of courts while offering them so
16                  SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                    Opinion of GORSUCH, J.

little by way of guidance is unconstitutionally vague. And
I do not see how we might reach a different judgment
here.
   Any lingering doubt is resolved for me by taking account
of just some of the questions judges trying to apply the
statute using an ordinary case analysis would have to
confront. Does a conviction for witness tampering ordinar­
ily involve a threat to the kneecaps or just the promise of a
bribe? Does a conviction for kidnapping ordinarily involve
throwing someone into a car trunk or a noncustodial par­
ent picking up a child from daycare? These questions do
not suggest obvious answers. Is the court supposed to
hold evidentiary hearings to sort them out, entertaining
experts with competing narratives and statistics, before
deciding what the ordinary case of a given crime looks like
and how much risk of violence it poses? What is the judge
to do if there aren’t any reliable statistics available?
Should (or must) the judge predict the effects of new tech­
nology on what qualifies as the ordinary case? After all,
surely the risk of injury calculus for crimes like larceny
can be expected to change as more thefts are committed by
computer rather than by gunpoint. Or instead of requir­
ing real evidence, does the statute mean to just leave it all
to a judicial hunch? And on top of all that may be the
most difficult question yet: at what level of generality is
the inquiry supposed to take place? Is a court supposed to
pass on the ordinary case of burglary in the relevant
neighborhood or county, or should it focus on statewide or
even national experience? How is a judge to know? How
are the people to know?
   The implacable fact is that this isn’t your everyday
ambiguous statute. It leaves the people to guess about
what the law demands—and leaves judges to make it up.
You cannot discern answers to any of the questions this
law begets by resorting to the traditional canons of statu­
tory interpretation. No amount of staring at the statute’s
                 Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)           17

                    Opinion of GORSUCH, J.

text, structure, or history will yield a clue. Nor does the
statute call for the application of some preexisting body of
law familiar to the judicial power. The statute doesn’t
even ask for application of common experience. Choice,
pure and raw, is required. Will, not judgment, dictates the
result.
                               *
  Having said this much, it is important to acknowledge
some limits on today’s holding too. I have proceeded on
the premise that the Immigration and Nationality Act, as
it incorporates §16(b) of the criminal code, commands
courts to determine the risk of violence attending the
ordinary case of conviction for a particular crime. I have
done so because no party before us has argued for a differ­
ent way to read these statutes in combination; because our
precedent seemingly requires this approach; and because
the government itself has conceded (repeatedly) that the
law compels it. Johnson, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 13);
Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575, 600 (1990); Brief for
Petitioner 11, 30, 32, 36, 40, 47 (conceding that an ordi­
nary case analysis is required).
  But any more than that I would not venture. In re­
sponse to the problems engendered by the ordinary case
analysis, JUSTICE THOMAS suggests that we should over­
look the government’s concession about the propriety of
that approach; reconsider our precedents endorsing it; and
read the statute as requiring us to focus on the facts of the
alien’s crime as committed rather than as the facts appear
in the ordinary case of conviction. Post, at 20–32. But
normally courts do not rescue parties from their conces­
sions, maybe least of all concessions from a party as able
to protect its interests as the federal government. And
normally, too, the crucible of adversarial testing is crucial
to sound judicial decisionmaking. We rely on it to “yield
insights (or reveal pitfalls) we cannot muster guided only
18                   SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                     Opinion of GORSUCH, J.

by our own lights.” Maslenjak v. United States, 582 U. S.
___, ___ (2017) (GORSUCH, J., concurring in part and con­
curring in judgment) (slip op., at 2).
   While sometimes we may or even must forgo the adver­
sarial process, I do not see the case for doing so today.
Maybe especially because I am not sure JUSTICE THOMAS’s
is the only available alternative reading of the statute we
would have to consider, even if we did reject the govern­
ment’s concession and wipe the precedential slate clean.
We might also have to consider an interpretation that
would have courts ask not whether the alien’s crime of
conviction ordinarily involves a risk of physical force, or
whether the defendant’s particular crime involved such a
risk, but whether the defendant’s crime of conviction
always does so. After all, the language before us requires
a conviction for an “offense . . . that, by its nature, involves
a substantial risk of physical force.” 18 U. S. C. §16(b)
(emphasis added). Plausibly, anyway, the word “nature”
might refer to an inevitable characteristic of the offense;
one that would present itself automatically, whenever the
statute is violated. See 10 Oxford English Dictionary 247
(2d ed. 1989). While I remain open to different arguments
about our precedent and the proper reading of language
like this, I would address them in another case, whether
involving the INA or a different statute, where the parties
have a chance to be heard and we might benefit from their
learning.
   It’s important to note the narrowness of our decision
today in another respect too. Vagueness doctrine repre­
sents a procedural, not a substantive, demand. It does not
forbid the legislature from acting toward any end it wishes,
but only requires it to act with enough clarity that
reasonable people can know what is required of them and
judges can apply the law consistent with their limited
office. Our history surely bears examples of the judicial
misuse of the so-called “substantive component” of due
                 Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)          19

                    Opinion of GORSUCH, J.

process to dictate policy on matters that belonged to the
people to decide. But concerns with substantive due pro­
cess should not lead us to react by withdrawing an ancient
procedural protection compelled by the original meaning of
the Constitution.
   Today’s decision sweeps narrowly in yet one more way.
By any fair estimate, Congress has largely satisfied the
procedural demand of fair notice even in the INA provision
before us. The statute lists a number of specific crimes
that can lead to a lawful resident’s removal—for example,
murder, rape, and sexual abuse of a minor. 8 U. S. C.
§1101(a)(43)(A). Our ruling today does not touch this list.
We address only the statute’s “residual clause” where
Congress ended its own list and asked us to begin writing
our own. Just as Blackstone’s legislature passed a revised
statute clarifying that “cattle” covers bulls and oxen,
Congress remains free at any time to add more crimes to
its list. It remains free, as well, to write a new residual
clause that affords the fair notice lacking here. Congress
might, for example, say that a conviction for any felony
carrying a prison sentence of a specified length opens an
alien to removal. Congress has done almost exactly this in
other laws. See, e.g., 18 U. S. C. §922(g). What was done
there could be done here.
   But those laws are not this law. And while the statute
before us doesn’t rise to the level of threatening death for
“pretended offences” of treason, no one should be surprised
that the Constitution looks unkindly on any law so vague
that reasonable people cannot understand its terms and
judges do not know where to begin in applying it. A gov­
ernment of laws and not of men can never tolerate that
arbitrary power. And, in my judgment, that foundational
principle dictates today’s result. Because I understand
them to be consistent with what I have said here, I join
Parts I, III, IV–B, and V of the Court’s opinion and concur
in the judgment.

JEFFERSON B. SESSIONS, III, ATTORNEY GENERAL,
     PETITIONER v. JAMES GARCIA DIMAYA
 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

                         [April 17, 2018] 


  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, with whom JUSTICE KENNEDY,
JUSTICE THOMAS, and JUSTICE ALITO join, dissenting.
  In Johnson v. United States, we concluded that the
residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act was
unconstitutionally vague, given the “indeterminacy of the
wide-ranging inquiry” it required. 576 U. S. ___, ___
(2015) (slip op., at 5). Today, the Court relies wholly on
Johnson—but only some of Johnson—to strike down an-
other provision, 18 U. S. C. §16(b). Because §16(b) does
not give rise to the concerns that drove the Court’s deci-
sion in Johnson, I respectfully dissent.
                           I
  The term “crime of violence” appears repeatedly
throughout the Federal Criminal Code. Section 16 of Title
18 defines it to mean:
    “(a) an offense that has as an element the use, at-
    tempted use, or threatened use of physical force
    against the person or property of another, or
    “(b) any other offense that is a felony and that, by its
    nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force
    against the person or property of another may be used
    in the course of committing the offense.”
This definition of “crime of violence” is also incorporated in
2                   SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

the definition of “aggravated felony” in the Immigration
and Nationality Act. 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(43)(F) (“aggra-
vated felony” includes “a crime of violence (as defined in
section 16 of title 18, but not including a purely political
offense) for which the term of imprisonment [is] at least
one year” (footnote omitted)). A conviction for an aggra-
vated felony carries serious consequences under the immi-
gration laws. It can serve as the basis for an alien’s re-
moval from the United States, and can preclude
cancellation of removal by the Attorney General.
§§1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), 1229b(a)(3).
  Those consequences came to pass in respondent James
Dimaya’s case. An Immigration Judge and the Board of
Immigration Appeals interpreted §16(b) to cover Dimaya’s
two prior convictions for first-degree residential burglary
under California law, subjecting him to removal. To stave
off that result, Dimaya argued that the language of §16(b)
was void for vagueness under the Due Process Clause of
the Fifth Amendment.
  The parties begin by disputing whether a criminal or
more relaxed civil vagueness standard should apply in
resolving Dimaya’s challenge. A plurality of the Court
rejects the Government’s argument in favor of a civil
standard, because of the “grave nature of deportation,”
Jordan v. De George, 341 U. S. 223, 231 (1951); see ante,
at 6 (plurality opinion); JUSTICE GORSUCH does so for
broader reasons, see ante, at 10–15 (GORSUCH, J., concur-
ring in part and concurring in judgment). I see no need to
resolve which standard applies, because I would hold that
§16(b) is not unconstitutionally vague even under the
standard applicable to criminal laws.
                             II
  This is not our first encounter with §16(b). In Leocal v.
Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1 (2004), we were asked to decide
whether either subsection of §16 covers a particular cate-
                  Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)            3

                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

gory of state crimes, specifically DUI offenses involving no
more than negligent conduct. 543 U. S., at 6. Far from
finding §16(b) “hopeless[ly] indetermina[te],” Johnson, 576
U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7), we considered the provision
clear and unremarkable: “while §16(b) is broader than
§16(a) in the sense that physical force need not actually be
applied,” the provision “simply covers offenses that natu-
rally involve a person acting in disregard of the risk that
physical force might be used against another in commit-
ting an offense,” Leocal, 543 U. S., at 10–11. Applying
that standard to the state offense at issue, we concluded—
unanimously—that §16(b) “cannot be read to include [a]
conviction for DUI causing serious bodily injury under
Florida law.” Id., at 11.
   Leocal thus provides a model for how courts should
assess whether a particular crime “by its nature” involves
a risk of the use of physical force. At the outset, our opin-
ion set forth the elements of the Florida DUI statute,
which made it a felony “for a person to operate a vehicle
while under the influence and, ‘by reason of such opera-
tion, caus[e] . . . [s]erious bodily injury to another.’ ” 543
U. S., at 7. Our §16(b) analysis, in turn, focused on those
specific elements in concluding that a Florida offender’s
acts would not naturally give rise to the requisite risk of
force “in the course of committing the offense.” Id., at 11.
“In no ‘ordinary or natural’ sense,” we explained, “can it be
said that a person risks having to ‘use’ physical force
against another person in the course of operating a vehicle
while intoxicated and causing injury.” Ibid.
   The Court holds that the same provision we had no
trouble applying in Leocal is in fact incapable of reasoned
application. The sole justification for this turnabout is the
resemblance between the language of §16(b) and the lan-
guage of the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal
Act (ACCA) that was at issue in Johnson. The latter
provision defined a “violent felony” to include “any crime
4                    SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one
year . . . that . . . is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves
use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that pre­
sents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.”
18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (emphasis added).
   In Johnson, we concluded that the ACCA residual
clause (the “or otherwise” language) gave rise to two forms
of intractable uncertainty, which “conspire[d]” to render
the provision unconstitutionally vague. 576 U. S., at ___
(slip op., at 5). First, the residual clause asked courts to
gauge the “potential risk” of “physical injury” posed by the
conduct involved in the crime. Ibid. That inquiry, we
determined, entailed not only an evaluation of the “crimi-
nal’s behavior,” but also required courts to consider “how
the idealized ordinary case of the crime subsequently
plays out.” Ibid. Second, the residual clause obligated
courts to compare that risk to an indeterminate stand-
ard—one that was inextricably linked to the provision’s
four enumerated crimes, which presented differing kinds
and degrees of risk. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6). This murky
confluence of features, each of which “may [have been]
tolerable in isolation,” together “ma[de] a task for us
which at best could be only guesswork.” Id., at ___ (slip
op., at 10).
   Section 16(b) does not present the same ambiguities.
The two provisions do correspond to some extent. Under
our decisions, both ask the sentencing court to consider
whether a particular offense, defined without regard to the
facts of the conviction, poses a specified risk. And, rele-
vant to both statutes, we have explained that in deciding
whether statutory elements inherently produce a risk, a
court must take into account how those elements will
ordinarily be fulfilled. See James v. United States, 550
U. S. 192, 208 (2007) (this categorical inquiry asks
“whether the conduct encompassed by the elements of the
                     Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)                    5

                       ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

offense, in the ordinary case, presents” the requisite risk).1
In the Court’s view, that effectively resolves this case. But
the Court too readily dismisses the significant textual
distinctions between §16(b) and the ACCA residual clause.
See also ante, at 2 (opinion of GORSUCH, J.). Those differ-
ences undermine the conclusion that §16(b) shares each
of the “dual flaws” of that clause. Ante, at 21 (majority
opinion).
  To begin, §16(b) yields far less uncertainty “about how
to estimate the risk posed by a crime.” Johnson, 576 U. S.,
at ___ (slip op., at 5). There are three material differences
between §16(b) and the ACCA residual clause in this
respect. First, the ACCA clause directed the reader to
consider whether the offender’s conduct presented a “po­
tential risk” of injury. Forced to give meaning to that
befuddling choice of phrase—which layered one indeter-
minate term on top of another—we understood the word
“potential” to signify that “Congress intended to encom-
pass possibilities even more contingent or remote than “a
simple ‘risk.’ ” James, 550 U. S., at 207–208. As we ex-
plained in Johnson, that made for a “speculative” inquiry
“detached from statutory elements.” 576 U. S., at ___ (slip
op., at 5). In other words, the offense elements could not
constrain the risk inquiry in the manner they do here. See
——————
  1 All this “ordinary case” caveat means is that while “[o]ne can always

hypothesize unusual cases in which even a prototypically violent crime
might not present a genuine risk,” courts should exclude those atypical
cases in assessing whether the offense qualifies. James, 550 U. S., at
208. As we have explained, under that approach, it is not the case that
“every conceivable factual offense covered by a statute” must pose the
requisite risk “before the offense can be deemed” a crime of violence.
Ibid. But the same is true of the categorical approach generally. See
ibid. (using the terms just quoted to characterize both the ordinary case
approach and the categorical approach for enumerated offenses set
forth in Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575 (1990)); Moncrieffe v.
Holder, 569 U. S. 184, 191 (2013); Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez, 549
U. S. 183, 193 (2007).

                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

Leocal, 543 U. S., at 11. The “serious potential risk”
standard also forced courts to assess in an expansive way
the “collateral consequences” of the perpetrator’s acts. For
example, courts had to take into account the concern that
others might cause injury in attempting to apprehend the
offender. See Sykes v. United States, 564 U. S. 1, 8–9
(2011). Section 16(b), on the other hand, asks about “risk”
alone, a familiar concept of everyday life. It therefore calls
for a commonsense inquiry that does not compel a court to
venture beyond the offense elements to consider contin-
gent and remote possibilities.
   Second, §16(b) focuses exclusively on the risk that the
offender will “use[ ]” “physical force” “against” another
person or another person’s property. Thus, unlike the
ACCA residual clause, “§16(b) plainly does not encompass
all offenses which create a ‘substantial risk’ that injury
will result from a person’s conduct.” Leocal, 543 U. S., at
10, n. 7 (emphasis added). The point is not that an inquiry
into the risk of “physical force” is markedly more determi-
nate than an inquiry into the risk of “physical injury.” But
see ante, at 19–20. The difference is that §16(b) asks
about the risk that the offender himself will actively em­
ploy force against person or property. That language does
not sweep in all instances in which the offender’s acts, or
another person’s reaction, might result in unintended or
negligent harm.
   Third, §16(b) has a temporal limit that the ACCA resid-
ual clause lacked: The “substantial risk” of force must
arise “in the course of committing the offense.” Properly
interpreted, this means the statute requires a substantial
risk that the perpetrator will use force while carrying out
the crime. See Leocal, 543 U. S., at 10 (“The reckless
disregard in §16 relates . . . to the risk that the use of
physical force against another might be required in com-
mitting a crime.”). The provision thereby excludes more
attenuated harms that might arise following the comple-
                 Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)           7

                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

tion of the crime. The ACCA residual clause, by contrast,
contained no similar language restricting its scope. And
the absence of such a limit, coupled with the reference to
“potential” risks, gave courts free rein to classify an of-
fense as a violent felony based on injuries that might occur
after the offense was over and done. See, e.g., United
States v. Benton, 639 F. 3d 723, 732 (CA6 2011) (finding
that “solicitation to commit aggravated assault” qualified
under the ACCA residual clause on the theory that the
solicited individual might subsequently carry out the
requested act).
   Why does any of this matter? Because it mattered in
Johnson. More precisely, the expansive language in the
ACCA residual clause contributed to our determination
that the clause gave rise to “grave uncertainty about how
to estimate the risk posed by a crime.” 576 U. S., at ___
(slip op., at 5). “Critically,” we said—a word that tends to
mean something—“picturing the criminal’s behavior is not
enough.” Ibid. (emphasis added). Instead, measuring
“potential risk” “seemingly require[d] the judge to imagine
how the idealized ordinary case of the crime subsequently
plays out.” Ibid. (emphasis added). Not so here. In apply-
ing §16(b), considering “the criminal’s behavior” is enough.
   Those three distinctions—the unadorned reference to
“risk,” the focus on the offender’s own active employment
of force, and the “in the course of committing” limitation—
also mean that many hard cases under ACCA are easier
under §16(b). Take the firearm possession crime from
Johnson itself, which had as its constituent elements
(1) unlawfully (2) possessing (3) a short-barreled shotgun.
None of those elements, “by its nature,” carries “a sub-
stantial risk” that the possessor will use force against
another “in the course of committing the offense.” Nothing
inherent in the act of firearm possession, even when it is
unlawful, gives rise to a substantial risk that the owner
will then shoot someone. See United States v. Serafin, 562
8                         SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                         ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

F. 3d 1105, 1113 (CA10 2009) (recognizing that “Leocal
instructs [a court] to focus not on whether possession will
likely result in violence, but instead whether one pos-
sessing an unregistered weapon necessarily risks the need
to employ force to commit possession”).2 Yet short-
barreled shotgun possession presented a closer question
under the ACCA residual clause, because the “serious
potential risk” language seemingly directed us to consider
“the circumstances and conduct that ordinarily attend the
offense,” in addition to the offense itself. Johnson, 576
U. S., at ___ (ALITO, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 17); see id.,
at ___–___ (slip op., at 19–20) (reasoning that the crime
must qualify because “a person who chooses to break the
law and risk the heavy criminal penalty incurred by pos-
sessing a notoriously dangerous weapon is [likely] to use
that weapon in violent ways”).
   Failure to report to a penal institution, the subject of
Chambers v. United States, 555 U. S. 122 (2009), is another
crime “whose treatment becomes more obvious under
§16(b) than under ACCA,” ante, at 18. In Chambers, the
——————
    2 TheCourt protests that this straightforward analysis fails to take
account of the crime’s ordinary case. Ante, at 18–19, n. 6. But the fact
that the element of “possession” may “take[ ] place in a variety of
ways”—for instance, one may possess a firearm “in a closet, in a store-
room, in a car, in a pocket,” “unloaded, disassembled, or locked away,”
Johnson, 576 U. S., at ___ (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (slip
op., at 4)—matters very little. That is because none of the alternative
ways of satisfying that element produce a substantial risk that the
possessor will use physical force against the person or property of
another. And no one would say that a person “possesses” a gun by
firing it or threatening someone with it. Cf. id., at ___ (opinion of
THOMAS, J.) (slip op., at 5) (“[T]he risk that the Government identifies
arises not from the act of possessing the weapon, but from the act of
using it.”). The Court’s insistence that this offense is nonetheless
“difficult to classify” under §16(b), ante, at 18, n. 6, is surprising in light
of our assessment, just two Terms ago, that §16 does not cover “felon-
in-possession laws and other firearms offenses,” Luna Torres v. Lynch,
578 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 13).

                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

Government argued that the requisite risk of injury arises
not necessarily at the time the offender fails to report to
prison, but instead later, when an officer attempts to
recapture the fugitive. 555 U. S., at 128. The majority is
correct that we ultimately “reject[ed]” the Government’s
contention. Ante, at 18. But we did so after “assum[ing]
for argument’s sake” its premise—that is, “the relevance of
violence that may occur long after an offender fails to
report.” 555 U. S., at 128; see id., at 129 (looking at 160
cases of “failure to report” and observing that “none at all
involved violence . . . during the commission of the offense
itself, [nor] during the offender’s later apprehension”).
The “in the course of committing the offense” language in
§16(b) helpfully forecloses that debate.
   DUI offenses are yet another example. Because §16(b)
asks about the risk that the offender will “use[ ]” “physical
force,” we readily concluded in Leocal that the subsection
does not cover offenses where the danger arises from the
offender’s negligent or accidental conduct, including drunk
driving. 543 U. S., at 11. Applying the ACCA residual
clause proved more trying. When asked to decide whether
the clause covered drunk driving offenses, a majority of
the Court concluded that the answer was no. Begay v.
United States, 553 U. S. 137 (2008). Our decision was
based, however, on the inference that the clause must
cover only “purposeful, ‘violent,’ and ‘aggressive’ con-
duct”—a test derived not from the “conduct that presents a
serious potential risk of physical injury” language, but
instead by reference to (what we guessed to be) the unify-
ing characteristics of the enumerated offenses. Id., at
144–145. Four Members of the Court criticized that test,
see id., at 150–153 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment);
id., at 158–160, 162–163 (ALITO, J., dissenting), though
they themselves disagreed about whether DUIs were
covered, see id., at 153–154 (opinion of Scalia, J.); id., at
156–158 (opinion of ALITO, J.). And the Court distanced
10                  SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

itself from the Begay requirement only a few years later
when confronting the crime of vehicular flight. See Sykes,
564 U. S., at 12–13; Johnson, 576 U. S., at ___–___ (slip
op., at 8–9).
   Which brings me to the second part of the Court’s analy-
sis: its objection that §16(b), like the ACCA residual
clause, leaves “uncertainty about the level of risk that
makes a crime ‘violent.’ ” Ante, at 10. The “substantial
risk” standard in §16(b) is significantly less confusing
because it is not tied to a disjointed list of paradigm of-
fenses. Recall that the ACCA provision defined a “violent
felony” to include a crime that “is burglary, arson, or
extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves
conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical
injury to another.” 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (emphasis
added). As our Court recognized early on, that “otherwise”
told the reader to understand the “serious potential risk of
physical injury” standard by way of the four enumerated
crimes. James, 550 U. S., at 203. But how, exactly? That
question dogged our residual clause cases for years, until
we said no más in Johnson.
   In our first foray, James, we resolved the case by asking
whether the risk posed by the crime of attempted burglary
was “comparable to that posed by its closest analog among
the enumerated offenses,” which was completed burglary.
550 U. S., at 203. While that rule “[took] care of attempted
burglary,” it “offer[ed] no help at all with respect to the
vast majority of offenses, which have no apparent analog
among the enumerated crimes.” Johnson, 576 U. S., at ___
(slip op., at 7). The James dissent, for its part, would have
determined the requisite degree of risk from the least
dangerous of the enumerated crimes, and compared the
offense to that. 550 U. S., at 218–219 (opinion of Scalia,
J.). But that approach also proved to be harder than it
sounded. See id., at 219–227.
   After James came Begay, in which we concluded that
                  Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)             11

                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

the enumerated offenses served as an independent limita-
tion on the kind of crime that could qualify. 553 U. S., at
142; see Chambers, 555 U. S., at 128 (applying the Begay
standard). As discussed, that test was short lived (though
we did not purport to wholly repudiate it). See Sykes, 564
U. S., at 13. Finally, in Sykes—our penultimate residual
clause case—we acknowledged the prior use of the closest-
analog test in James, but instead focused on whether the
risk posed by vehicular flight was “similar in degree of
danger” to the listed offenses of arson and burglary. 564
U. S., at 8–10. As a result, Justice Scalia’s dissent charac-
terized the Sykes majority as applying the test from his
prior dissent in James, not James itself. See 564 U. S., at
29–30, 33. This series of precedents laid bare our “repeated
inability to craft a principled test out of the statutory
text,” id., at 34 (opinion of Scalia, J.), as the Court ulti-
mately acknowledged in Johnson, 576 U. S., at ___ (slip
op., at 7).
   The enumerated offenses, and our Court’s failed at-
tempts to make sense of them, were essential to Johnson’s
conclusion that the residual clause “leaves uncertainty
about how much risk it takes for a crime to qualify as a
violent felony.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6). As Johnson
explained, the issue was not that the statute employed a
fuzzy standard. That kind of thing appears in the statute
books all the time. Id., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 6, 12). In
the majority’s retelling today, the difficulty inhered solely
in the fact that the statute paired such a standard with
the ordinary case inquiry. See ante, at 8, 10–11, 21. But
that account sidesteps much of Johnson’s reasoning. See
576 U. S., at ___–___, ___, ___–___, ___ (slip op., at 4–5, 6,
7–9, 12). Our opinion emphasized that the word “other-
wise” “force[d]” courts to interpret the amorphous stand-
ard “in light of ” the four enumerated crimes, which are
“not much more similar to one another in kind than in
degree of risk posed.” Id., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 6, 8). Or,
12                       SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                        ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

as Johnson put it more vividly, “[t]he phrase ‘shades of
red,’ standing alone, does not generate confusion or un-
predictability; but the phrase ‘fire-engine red, light pink,
maroon, navy blue, or colors that otherwise involve shades
of red’ assuredly does so.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 12).
Indeed, the author of Johnson had previously, and repeat-
edly, described this feature of the residual clause as the
“crucial . . . respect” in which the law was problematic.
See James, 550 U. S., at 230, n. 7 (opinion of Scalia, J.);
Sykes, 564 U. S., at 35 (opinion of Scalia, J.).
   With §16(b), by contrast, a court need simply consider
the meaning of the word “substantial”—a word our Court
has interpreted and applied innumerable times across a
wide variety of contexts.3 The court does not need to give
that familiar word content by reference to four different
offenses with varying amounts and kinds of risk.
   In its effort to recast a considerable portion of Johnson
as dicta, the majority speculates that if the enumerated
offenses had truly mattered to the outcome, the Court
would have told lower courts to “give up on trying to inter-
pret the clause by reference to” those offenses, rather than
striking down the provision entirely. Ante, at 21. No
litigant in Johnson suggested that solution, which is not
surprising. Such judicial redrafting could have expanded
the reach of the criminal provision—surely a job for Con-

gress alone.
  In any event, I doubt the majority’s proposal would have
done the trick. And that is because the result in Johnson
did not follow from the presence of one frustrating textual
feature or another. Quite the opposite: The decision em-
phasized that it was the “sum” of the “uncertainties” in the
ACCA residual clause, confirmed by years of experience,
that “convince[d]” us the provision was beyond salvage.
Johnson, 576 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10). Those failings
do not characterize the provision at issue here.
                           III
  The more constrained inquiry required under §16(b)—
which asks only whether the offense elements naturally
carry with them a risk that the offender will use force in
committing the offense—does not itself engender “grave
uncertainty about how to estimate the risk posed by a
crime.” And the provision’s use of a commonplace sub-
stantial risk standard—one not tied to a list of crimes that
lack a unifying feature—does not give rise to intolerable
“uncertainty about how much risk it takes for a crime to
qualify.” That should be enough to reject Dimaya’s facial
vagueness challenge.4
  Because I would rely on those distinctions to uphold

——————
   4 The Court also finds it probative that “a host of issues” respecting

§16(b) “divide” the lower courts. Ante, at 22. Yet the Court does little
to explain how those alleged conflicts vindicate its particular concern
about the provision (namely, the ordinary case inquiry). And as the
Government illustrates, many of those divergent results likely can be
chalked up to material differences in the state offense statutes at issue.
Compare Escudero-Arciniega v. Holder, 702 F. 3d 781, 783–785 (CA5
2012) (per curiam) (reasoning that New Mexico car burglary “requires
that the criminal lack authorization to enter the vehicle—a require-
ment alone which will most often ensure some force [against property]
is used”), with Sareang Ye v. INS, 214 F. 3d 1128, 1134 (CA9 2000)
(finding it relevant that California car burglary does not require unlaw-
ful or unprivileged entry); see Reply Brief 17–20, and nn. 5–6.

                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting

§16(b), the Court reproaches me for not giving sufficient
weight to a “core insight” of Johnson. Ante, at 10, n. 4; see
ante, at 15 (opinion of GORSUCH, J.) (arguing that §16(b)
runs afoul of Johnson “to the extent [§16(b)] requires an
‘ordinary case’ analysis”). But the fact that the ACCA
residual clause required the ordinary case approach was
not itself sufficient to doom the law. We instead took
pains to clarify that our opinion should not be read to
impart such an absolute rule. See Johnson, 576 U. S., at
___ (slip op., at 10). I would adhere to that careful holding
and not reflexively extend the decision to a different stat-
ute whose reach is, on the whole, far more clear.
   The Court does the opposite, and the ramifications of
that decision are significant. First, of course, today’s
holding invalidates a provision of the Immigration and
Nationality Act—part of the definition of “aggravated
felony”—on which the Government relies to “ensure that
dangerous criminal aliens are removed from the United
States.” Brief for United States 54. Contrary to the
Court’s back-of-the-envelope assessment, see ante, at 23,
n. 12, the Government explains that the definition is
“critical” for “numerous” immigration provisions. Brief for
United States 12.
   In addition, §16 serves as the universal definition of
“crime of violence” for all of Title 18 of the United States
Code. Its language is incorporated into many procedural
and substantive provisions of criminal law, including
provisions concerning racketeering, money laundering,
domestic violence, using a child to commit a violent crime,
and distributing information about the making or use of
explosives. See 18 U. S. C. §§25(a)(1), 842(p)(2), 1952(a),
1956(c)(7)(B)(ii), 1959(a)(4), 2261(a), 3561(b). Of special
concern, §16 is replicated in the definition of “crime of
violence” applicable to §924(c), which prohibits using or
carrying a firearm “during and in relation to any crime of
violence,” or possessing a firearm “in furtherance of any

such crime.” §§924(c)(1)(A), (c)(3). Though I express no
view on whether §924(c) can be distinguished from the
provision we consider here, the Court’s holding calls into
question convictions under what the Government warns
us is an “oft-prosecuted offense.”     Brief for United
States 12.
  Because Johnson does not compel today’s result, I
respectfully dissent.

JEFFERSON B. SESSIONS, III, ATTORNEY GENERAL,
     PETITIONER v. JAMES GARCIA DIMAYA
 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

                         [April 17, 2018] 


   JUSTICE THOMAS, with whom JUSTICE KENNEDY and
JUSTICE ALITO join as to Parts I–C–2, II–A–1, and II–B,
dissenting.
   I agree with THE CHIEF JUSTICE that 18 U. S. C. §16(b),
as incorporated by the Immigration and Nationality Act
(INA), is not unconstitutionally vague. Section 16(b) lacks
many of the features that caused this Court to invalidate
the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act
(ACCA) in Johnson v. United States, 576 U. S. ___ (2015).
ACCA’s residual clause—a provision that this Court had
applied four times before Johnson—was not unconstitu­
tionally vague either. See id., at ___ (THOMAS, J., concur­
ring in judgment) (slip op., at 1); id., at ___–___ (ALITO, J.,
dissenting) (slip op., at 13–17). But if the Court insists on
adhering to Johnson, it should at least take Johnson at its
word that the residual clause was vague due to the “ ‘sum’ ”
of its specific features. Id., at ___ (majority opinion) (slip
op., at 10). By ignoring this limitation, the Court jettisons
Johnson’s assurance that its holding would not jeopardize
“dozens of federal and state criminal laws.” Id., at ___
(slip op., at 12).
   While THE CHIEF JUSTICE persuasively explains why
respondent cannot prevail under our precedents, I write
separately to make two additional points. First, I continue
to doubt that our practice of striking down statutes as
2                   SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                    THOMAS, J., dissenting

unconstitutionally vague is consistent with the original
meaning of the Due Process Clause. See id., at ___–___
(opinion of THOMAS, J.) (slip op., at 7–18). Second, if the
Court thinks that §16(b) is unconstitutionally vague be­
cause of the “categorical approach,” see ante, at 6–11, then
the Court should abandon that approach—not insist on
reading it into statutes and then strike them down. Ac­
cordingly, I respectfully dissent.
                              I
   I continue to harbor doubts about whether the vague­
ness doctrine can be squared with the original meaning of
the Due Process Clause—and those doubts are only ampli­
fied in the removal context. I am also skeptical that the
vagueness doctrine can be justified as a way to prevent
delegations of core legislative power in this context. But I
need not resolve these questions because, if the vagueness
doctrine has any basis in the Due Process Clause, it must
be limited to cases in which the statute is unconstitution­
ally vague as applied to the person challenging it. That is
not the case for respondent, whose prior convictions for
first-degree residential burglary in California fall comfort­
ably within the scope of §16(b).

   The Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause provides
that no person shall be “deprived of life, liberty, or prop-
erty, without due process of law.” Section 16(b), as incorpo­
rated by the INA, cannot violate this Clause unless the
following propositions are true: The Due Process Clause
requires federal statutes to provide certain minimal pro­
cedures, the vagueness doctrine is one of those procedures,
and the vagueness doctrine applies to statutes governing
the removal of aliens. Although I need not resolve any of
these propositions today, each one is questionable. I will
address them in turn.

   First, the vagueness doctrine is not legitimate unless
the “law of the land” view of due process is incorrect.
Under that view, due process “require[s] only that our
Government . . . proceed . . . according to written constitu­
tional and statutory provision[s] before depriving someone
of life, liberty, or property.” Nelson v. Colorado, 581 U. S.
___, ___, n. 1 (2017) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 2,
n. 1) (internal quotation marks omitted). More than a half
century after the founding, the Court rejected this view of
due process in Murray’s Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Im-
provement Co., 18 How. 272 (1856). See id., at 276 (hold­
ing that the Due Process Clause “is a restraint on the
legislative as well as on the executive and judicial powers
of the government”). But the textual and historical sup­
port for the law-of-the-land view is not insubstantial.1
                             2
  Even under Murray’s Lessee, the vagueness doctrine is
legitimate only if it is a “settled usag[e] and mod[e] of
proceeding existing in the common and statute law of
England, before the emigration of our ancestors.” Id., at
277. That proposition is dubious. Until the end of the
19th century, “there is little indication that anyone . . .
believed that courts had the power under the Due Process
Claus[e] to nullify statutes on [vagueness] ground[s].”

11). That is not because Americans were unfamiliar with
vague laws. Rather, early American courts, like their
English predecessors, addressed vague laws through
statutory construction instead of constitutional law. See
Note, Void for Vagueness: An Escape From Statutory
Interpretation, 23 Ind. L. J. 272, 274–279 (1948). They
invoked the rule of lenity and declined to apply vague
penal statutes on a case-by-case basis. See Johnson, 576
U. S., at ___–___ (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (slip op., at 7–10);
e.g., ante, at 5–6, and n. 1 (GORSUCH, J., concurring in part
and concurring in judgment) (collecting cases).2 The mod­
ern vagueness doctrine, which claims the judicial author­
ity to “strike down” vague legislation on its face, did not
emerge until the turn of the 20th century. See Johnson,
576 U. S., at ___–___ (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (slip op., at
11–13).
   The difference between the traditional rule of lenity and


——————
   2 Before the 19th century, when virtually all felonies were punishable

by death, English courts would sometimes go to extremes to find a
reason to invoke the rule of lenity. See Hall, Strict or Liberal Construc­
tion of Penal Statutes, 48 Harv. L. Rev. 748, 751 (1935); e.g., ante, at 4–
7 (GORSUCH, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (citing
Blackstone’s discussion of a case about “cattle”). As the death penalty
became less common, courts on this side of the Atlantic tempered the
rule of lenity, clarifying that the rule requires an “ambiguity” in the
text and cannot be used “to defeat the obvious intention of the legisla­
ture.” United States v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76 (1820) (Marshall, C. J.).
   Early American courts also declined to apply nonpenal statutes that
were “unintelligible.” Johnson v. United States, 576 U. S. ___, ___, n. 3
(2014) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 10, n. 3); e.g.,
ante, at 5–6, and n. 1 (opinion of GORSUCH, J.) (collecting cases). Like
lenity, however, this practice reflected a principle of statutory construc­
tion that was much narrower than the modern constitutional vagueness
doctrine. Unintelligible statutes were considered inoperative because
they were impossible to apply to individual cases, not because they
were unconstitutional for failing to provide “fair notice.” See Johnson,
576 U. S., at ___, n. 3 (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (slip op., at 10, n. 3).

the modern vagueness doctrine is not merely semantic.
Most obviously, lenity is a tool of statutory construction,
which means States can abrogate it—and many have.
Hall, Strict or Liberal Construction of Penal Statutes, 48
Harv. L. Rev. 748, 752–754 (1935); see also Scalia, Assorted
Canards of Contemporary Legal Analysis, 40 Case W.
Res. L. Rev. 581, 583 (1989) (“Arizona, by the way, seems
to have preserved a fair and free society without adopting
the rule that criminal statutes are to be strictly construed”
(citing Ariz. Rev. Stat. §1-211C (1989))). The vagueness
doctrine, by contrast, is a rule of constitutional law that
States cannot alter or abolish. Lenity, moreover, applies
only to “penal” statutes, 1 Blackstone, Commentaries on
the Laws of England 88 (1765), but the vagueness doctrine
extends to all regulations of individual conduct, both penal
and nonpenal, Johnson, 576 U. S., at ___ (opinion of
THOMAS, J.) (slip op., at 6); see also Note, Indefinite Crite­
ria of Definiteness in Statutes, 45 Harv. L. Rev. 160, 163
(1931) (explaining that the modern vagueness doctrine
was not merely an “extension of the rule of strict construc­
tion of penal statutes” because it “expressly include[s] civil
statutes within its scope,” reflecting a “regrettable disre­
gard” for legislatures).3 In short, early American courts
were not applying the modern vagueness doctrine by
another name. They were engaged in a fundamentally
different enterprise.
    Tellingly, the modern vagueness doctrine emerged at a
time when this Court was actively interpreting the Due

  3 This distinction between penal and nonpenal statutes would be

decisive here because, traditionally, civil deportation laws were not
considered penal. See Bugajewitz v. Adams, 228 U. S. 585, 591 (1913);
Fong Yue Ting v. United States, 149 U. S. 698, 709, 730 (1893). Al-
though this Court has applied a kind of strict construction to civil
deportation laws, that practice did not emerge until the mid-20th
century. See Fong Haw Tan v. Phelan, 333 U. S. 6, 10 (1948).

Process Clause to strike down democratically enacted
laws—first in the name of the “liberty of contract,” then in
the name of the “right to privacy.” See Johnson, 576 U. S.,
at ___–___ (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (slip op., at 13–16).
That the vagueness doctrine “develop[ed] on the federal
level concurrently with the growth of the tool of substan­
tive due process” does not seem like a coincidence. Note,
23 Ind. L. J., at 278. Like substantive due process, the
vagueness doctrine provides courts with “open-ended
authority to oversee [legislative] choices.” Kolender v.
Lawson, 461 U. S. 352, 374 (1983) (White, J., dissenting).
This Court, for example, has used the vagueness doctrine
to invalidate antiloitering laws, even though those laws
predate the Declaration of Independence. See Johnson,
supra, at ___ (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (slip op., at 7) (dis­
cussing Chicago v. Morales, 527 U. S. 41 (1999)).
   This Court also has a bad habit of invoking the Due
Process Clause to constitutionalize rules that were tradi­
tionally left to the democratic process. See, e.g., Williams
v. Pennsylvania, 579 U. S. ___ (2016); BMW of North
America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U. S. 559 (1996); Foucha v.
Louisiana, 504 U. S. 71 (1992); cf. Montgomery v. Louisi-
ana, 577 U. S. ___ (2016). If vagueness is another example
of this practice, then that is all the more reason to doubt
its legitimacy.
                             3
  Even assuming the Due Process Clause prohibits vague
laws, this prohibition might not apply to laws governing
the removal of aliens. Cf. Johnson, 576 U. S., at ___, n. 7
(opinion of THOMAS, J.) (slip op., at 17, n. 7) (stressing the
need for specificity when assessing alleged due process
rights). The Founders were familiar with English law,
where “ ‘the only question that ha[d] ever been made in
regard to the power to expel aliens [was] whether it could
be exercised by the King without the consent of Parlia­

ment.’ ”   Demore v. Kim, 538 U. S. 510, 538 (2003)
(O’Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg­
ment) (quoting Fong Yue Ting v. United States, 149 U. S.
698, 709 (1893)). And, in this country, the notion that the
Due Process Clause governed the removal of aliens was
not announced until the 20th century.
   Less than a decade after the ratification of the Bill of
Rights, the founding generation had an extensive debate
about the relationship between the Constitution and
federal removal statutes. In 1798, the Fifth Congress
enacted the Alien Acts. One of those Acts, the Alien
Friends Act, gave the President unfettered discretion to
expel any aliens “he shall judge dangerous to the peace
and safety of the United States, or shall have reasonable
grounds to suspect are concerned in any treasonable or
secret machinations against the government thereof.” An
Act Concerning Aliens §1, 1 Stat. 571. This statute was
modeled after the Aliens Act 1793 in England, which
similarly gave the King unfettered discretion to expel
aliens as he “shall think necessary for the publick Secur­
ity.” 33 Geo. III, ch. 4, §18, in 39 Eng. Stat. at Large 16.
Both the Fifth Congress and the States thoroughly de-
bated the Alien Friends Act. Virginia and Kentucky enacted
resolutions (anonymously drafted by Madison and Jeffer­
son) opposing the Act, while 10 States enacted counter-
resolutions condemning the views of Virginia and Ken­
tucky. See Fehlings, Storm on the Constitution: The First
Deportation Law, 10 Tulsa J. Comp. & Int’l L. 63, 85, 103
(2002).

the Alien Friends Act as a threat to their party and the
institution of slavery,4 raised a number of constitutional

objections. Some of the Jeffersonians argued that the
Alien Friends Act violated the Fifth Amendment’s Due
Process Clause. They complained that the Act failed to
provide aliens with all the accouterments of a criminal
trial. See, e.g., Kentucky Resolutions ¶6, in 4 The Debates
in the Several Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal
Constitution 541–542 (J. Elliot ed. 1836) (Elliot’s Debates);
8 Annals of Cong. 1982–1983 (1798) (statement of Rep.
Gallatin); Madison’s Report on the Virginia Resolutions
(Jan. 7, 1800), in 6 Writings of James Madison 361–362
(G. Hunt ed. 1906) (Madison’s Report).5
   The Federalists gave two primary responses to this due
process argument. First, the Federalists argued that the
rights of aliens were governed by the law of nations, not
the Constitution. See, e.g., Randolph, Debate on Virginia
Resolutions, in The Virginia Report of 1799–1800, pp. 34–
35 (1850) (Virginia Debates) (statement of George K.
Taylor) (arguing that aliens “were not a party to the [Con­
stitution]” and that “cases between the government and

——————
political strength came from the South. See Fehlings, Storm on the
Constitution: The First Deportation Law, 10 Tulsa J. Comp. & Int’l L.
63, 84 (2002). The Jeffersonians opposed any federal control over
immigration, which their constituents feared would be used to pre-empt
State laws that prohibited the entry of free blacks. Id., at 84–85; see
also Berns, Freedom of the Press and the Alien and Sedition Laws: A
Reappraisal, 1970 S. Ct. Rev. 109, 116 (“Whether pro- or anti-slavery,
most southerners, including Jefferson and Madison . . . were united
behind a policy of denying to the national government any competence
to deal with the question of slavery”). The fear was that “mobile free
Negroes would intermingle with slaves, encourage them to run away,
and foment insurrection.” I. Berlin, Slaves Without Masters 92 (1974).
  5 The Jeffersonians also argued that the Alien Friends Act violated

due process because, if aliens disobeyed the President’s orders to leave
the country, they could be convicted of a crime and imprisoned without
a trial. See, e.g., Kentucky Resolutions ¶6, 4 Elliot’s Debates 541. That
charge was false. The Alien Friends Act gave federal courts jurisdiction
over alleged violations of the President’s orders. See §4, 1 Stat. 571.

aliens . . . arise under the law of nations”); id., at 100
(statement of William Cowan) (identifying the source of
rights “as to citizens, the Constitution; as to aliens, the
law of nations”); A. Addison, A Charge to the Grand Juries
of the County Courts of the Fifth Circuit of the State of
Pennsylvania 18 (1799) (Charge to the Grand Juries)
(“[T]he Constitution leaves aliens, as in other countries, to
the protection of the general principles of the law of na­
tions”); Answer to the Resolutions of the State of Ken­
tucky, Oct. 29, 1799, in 4 Records of the Governor and
Council of the State of Vermont 528 (1876) (denying “that
aliens had any rights among us, except what they derived
from the law of nations, and rights of hospitality”). The
law of nations imposed no enforceable limits on a nation’s
power to remove aliens. See, e.g., 1 E. de Vattel, Law of
Nations, §§230–231, pp. 108–109 (J. Chitty et al. transl.
and ed. 1883).
   Second, the Federalists responded that the expulsion of
aliens “did not touch life, liberty, or property.” Virginia
Debates 34. The founding generation understood the
phrase “life, liberty, or property” to refer to a relatively
narrow set of core private rights that did not depend on
the will of the government. See Wellness Int’l Network,
Ltd. v. Sharif, 575 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2015) (THOMAS, J.,
dissenting) (slip op., at 9–10); Nelson, Adjudication in the
Political Branches, 107 Colum. L. Rev. 559, 566–568
(2007) (Nelson).      Quasi-private rights—“privileges” or
“franchises” bestowed by the government on individuals—
did not qualify and could be taken away without judicial
process. See B&B Hardware, Inc. v. Hargis Industries,
Inc., 575 U. S. ___, ___ (2015) (THOMAS, J., dissenting)
(slip op., at 12); Nelson 567–569. The Federalists argued
that an alien’s right to reside in this country was one such
privilege. See, e.g., Virginia Debates 34 (arguing that
“ordering away an alien . . . was not a matter of right, but
of favour,” which did not require a jury trial); Report of the
10                   SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

Select Committee of the House of Representatives, Made
to the House of Representatives on Feb. 21, 1799, 9 Annals
of Cong. 2987 (1799) (stating that aliens “remain in the
country . . . merely as matter of favor and permission” and
can be removed at any time without a criminal trial);
Charge to the Grand Juries 11–13 (similar). According to
the Minority Address of the Virginia Legislature (anony­
mously drafted by John Marshall), “[T]he right of remain­
ing in our country is vested in no alien; he enters and
remains by the courtesy of the sovereign power, and that
courtesy may at pleasure be withdrawn” without judicial
process. Address of the Minority in the Virginia Legisla­
ture to the People of that State 9–10 (1799) (Virginia
Minority Address).       Unlike “a grant of land,” the
“[a]dmission of an alien to residence . . . is revocable, like a
permission.” A. Addison, Analysis of the Report of the
Committee of the Virginia Assembly 23 (1800). Removing
a resident alien from the country did not affect “life, lib­
erty, or property,” the Federalists argued, until the alien
became a naturalized citizen. See id., at 23–24; Charge to
the Grand Juries 11–13. That the alien’s permanent
residence was conferred by statute would not have made a
difference. See Nelson 571, 580–582; Teva Pharmaceuti-
cals USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., 574 U. S. ___, ___, n. 2
(2015) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 9, n. 2).
   After the Alien Friends Act lapsed in 1800, Congress did
not enact another removal statute for nearly a century.
The States enacted their own removal statutes during this
period, see G. Neuman, Strangers to the Constitution 19–
43 (1996), and I am aware of no decision questioning the
legality of these statutes under State due-process or law­
of-the-land provisions. Beginning in the late 19th century,
the Federal Government reinserted itself into the regula­
tion of immigration. When this Court was presented with
constitutional challenges to Congress’ removal laws, it
initially rejected them for many of the same reasons that
                  Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)           11

                     THOMAS, J., dissenting

Marshall and the Federalists had cited in defense of the
Alien Friends Act. Although the Court rejected the Feder­
alists’ argument that resident aliens do not enjoy constitu­
tional rights, see Wong Wing v. United States, 163 U. S.
228, 238 (1896), it agreed that civil deportation statutes do
not implicate “life, liberty, or property,” see, e.g., Harisi-
ades v. Shaughnessy, 342 U. S. 580, 584–585 (1952) (“[T]hat
admission for permanent residence confers a ‘vested right’
on the alien [is] not founded in precedents of this Court”);
United States ex rel. Turner v. Williams, 194 U. S. 279,
290 (1904) (“[T]he deportation of an alien who is found to
be here in violation of law is not a deprivation of liberty
without due process of law”); Fong Yue Ting, 149 U. S., at
730 (“[Deportation] is but a method of enforcing the return
to his own country of an alien who has not complied with
[statutory] conditions . . . . He has not, therefore, been
deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of
law”); id., at 713–715 (similar). Consistent with this
understanding, “federal immigration laws from 1891 until
1952 made no express provision for judicial review.”
Demore, 538 U. S., at 538 (opinion of O’Connor, J.).
    It was not until the 20th century that this Court held
that nonpenal removal statutes could violate the Due
Process Clause. See Wong Yang Sung v. McGrath, 339
U. S. 33, 49 (1950). That ruling opened the door for the
Court to apply the then-nascent vagueness doctrine to
immigration statutes. But the Court upheld vague stand­
ards in immigration laws that it likely would not have
tolerated in criminal statutes. See, e.g., Boutilier v. INS,
387 U. S. 118, 122 (1967) (“ ‘psychopathic personality’ ”);
Jordan v. De George, 341 U. S. 223, 232 (1951) (“ ‘crime
involving moral turpitude’ ”); cf. Mahler, supra, at 40
(“ ‘undesirable residents’ ”). Until today, this Court has
never held that an immigration statute is unconstitution­
ally vague.
    Thus, for more than a century after the founding, it was,
12                  SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                    THOMAS, J., dissenting

at best, unclear whether federal removal statutes could
violate the Due Process Clause. And until today, this
Court had never deemed a federal removal statute void for
vagueness. Given this history, it is difficult to conclude
that a ban on vague removal statutes is a “settled usag[e]
and mod[e] of proceeding existing in the common and
statute law of England, before the emigration of our ances­
tors” protected by the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process
Clause. Murray’s Lessee, 18 How., at 277.
                               B
   Instead of a longstanding procedure under Murray’s
Lessee, perhaps the vagueness doctrine is really a way to
enforce the separation of powers—specifically, the doctrine
of nondelegation. See Chapman & McConnell, Due Pro­
cess as Separation of Powers, 121 Yale L. J. 1672, 1806
(2012) (“Vague statutes have the effect of delegating law­
making authority to the executive”). Madison raised a
similar objection to the Alien Friends Act, arguing that its
expansive language effectively allowed the President to
exercise legislative (and judicial) power. See Madison’s
Report 369–371. And this Court’s precedents have occa­
sionally described the vagueness doctrine in terms of
nondelegation. See, e.g., Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408
U. S. 104, 108–109 (1972) (“A vague law impermissibly
delegates basic policy matters”). But they have not been
consistent on this front. See, e.g., Aptheker v. Secretary of
State, 378 U. S. 500, 516 (1964) (“ ‘The objectionable qual-
ity of vagueness . . . does not depend upon . . . unchanneled
delegation of legislative powers’ ”); Maynard v. Cartwright,
486 U. S. 356, 361 (1988) (“Objections to vagueness under
the Due Process Clause rest on the lack of notice”).
   I agree that the Constitution prohibits Congress from
delegating core legislative power to another branch. See
Department of Transportation v. Association of American
Railroads, 575 U. S. ___, ___ (2015) (AAR) (THOMAS, J.,

concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 3) (“Congress improp­
erly ‘delegates’ legislative power when it authorizes an
entity other than itself to make a determination that
requires an exercise of legislative power”); accord, Whit-
man v. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 487
(2001) (THOMAS, J., concurring). But I locate that princi­
ple in the Vesting Clauses of Articles I, II, and III—not in
the Due Process Clause. AAR, supra, at ___–___ (opinion
of THOMAS, J.) (slip op., at 2–3); see also Hampton v. Mow
Sun Wong, 426 U. S. 88, 123 (1976) (Rehnquist, J., dis­
senting) (“[T]hat there was an improper delegation of
authority . . . has not previously been thought to depend
upon the procedural requirements of the Due Process
Clause”). In my view, impermissible delegations of legis­
lative power violate this principle, not just delegations
that deprive individuals of “life, liberty, or property,”
Amdt. 5.
   Respondent does not argue that §16(b), as incorporated
by the INA, is an impermissible delegation of power. See
Brief for Respondent 50 (stating that “there is no delega­
tion question” in this case). I would not reach that ques­
tion here, because this case can be resolved on narrower
grounds. See Part I–C, infra. But at first blush, it is not
at all obvious that the nondelegation doctrine would jus­
tify wholesale invalidation of §16(b).
   If §16(b) delegates power in this context, it delegates
power primarily to the Executive Branch entities that
administer the INA—namely, the Attorney General, im­
migration judges, and the Board of Immigration Appeals
(BIA). But Congress does not “delegate” when it merely
authorizes the Executive Branch to exercise a power that
it already has. See AAR, supra, at ___ (opinion of
THOMAS, J.) (slip op., at 3). And there is some founding-
era evidence that “the executive Power,” Art. II, §1, in­
cludes the power to deport aliens.

writings on executive power were “most familiar to the
Framers,” Prakash & Ramsey, The Executive Power Over
Foreign Affairs, 111 Yale L. J. 231, 253 (2001)—described
the power to deport aliens as executive and located it with
the King. Alien friends, Blackstone explained, are “liable
to be sent home whenever the king sees occasion.” 1
Commentaries on the Laws of England 252 (1765). When
our Constitution was ratified, moreover, “[e]minent Eng­
lish judges, sitting in the Judicial Committee of the Privy
Council, ha[d] gone very far in supporting the . . . expul­
sion, by the executive authority of a colony, of aliens.”
Demore, 538 U. S., at 538 (opinion of O’Connor, J.) (quot­
ing Fong Yue Ting, 149 U. S., at 709). Some of the Feder­
alists defending the Alien Friends Act similarly argued
that the President had the power to remove aliens. See,
e.g., Virginia Debates 35 (statement of George K. Taylor)
(arguing that the power to remove aliens is “most properly
entrusted” with the President, since “[h]e, by the Constitu­
tion, was bound to execute the laws” and is “the executive
officer, with whom all persons and bodies whatever were
accustomed to communicate”); Virginia Minority Address
9 (arguing that the removal of aliens “is a measure of
general safety, in its nature political and not forensic, the
execution of which is properly trusted to the department
which represents the nation in all its interior relations”);
Charge to the Grand Juries 29–30 (“As a measure of na­
tional defence, this discretion, of expulsion or indulgence,
seems properly vested in the branch of the government
peculiarly charged with the direction of the executive
powers, and of our foreign relations. There is in it a mix­
ture of external policy, and of the law of nations, that
justifies this disposition”). More recently, this Court
recognized that “[r]emoval decisions” implicate “our cus­
tomary policy of deference to the President in matters of
foreign affairs” because they touch on “our relations with
foreign powers and require consideration of changing

political and economic circumstances.” Jama v. Immigra-
tion and Customs Enforcement, 543 U. S. 335, 348 (2005)
(internal quotation marks omitted). Taken together, this
evidence makes it difficult to confidently conclude that the
INA, through §16(b), delegates core legislative power to
the Executive.
   Instead of the Executive, perhaps §16(b) impermissibly
delegates power to the Judiciary, since the Courts of Ap­
peals often review the BIA’s application of §16(b). I as­
sume that, at some point, a statute could be so devoid of
content that a court tasked with interpreting it “would
simply be making up a law—that is, exercising legislative
power.” Lawson, Delegation and Original Meaning, 88 Va.
L. Rev. 327, 339 (2002); see id., at 339–340 (providing
examples such as a gibberish-filled statute or a statute
that requires “ ‘goodness and niceness’ ”). But I am not
confident that our modern vagueness doctrine—which
focuses on whether regulations of individual conduct
provide “fair warning,” are “clearly defined,” and do not
encourage “arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement,”
Grayned, 408 U. S., at 108; Kolender, 461 U. S., at 357—
accurately demarcates the line between legislative and
judicial power. The Founders understood that the inter­
pretation of legal texts, even vague ones, remained an
exercise of core judicial power. See Perez v. Mortgage
Bankers Assn., 575 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2015) (THOMAS, J.,
concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 8–9); Hamburger, The
Constitution’s Accommodation of Social Change, 88 Mich.
L. Rev. 239, 303–310 (1989). Courts were expected to
clarify the meaning of such texts over time as they applied
their terms to specific cases. See id., at 309–310; Nelson,
Originalism and Interpretive Conventions, 70 U. Chi. L.
Rev. 519, 526 (2003). Although early American courts
declined to apply vague or unintelligible statutes as ap­
propriate in individual cases, they did not wholesale inval­
idate them as unconstitutional delegations of legislative
16                   SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

power. See Johnson, 576 U. S., at ___–___, and n. 3 (opin­
ion of THOMAS, J.) (slip op., at 10–11, and n. 3).

                               1
  I need not resolve these historical questions today, as
this case can be decided on narrower grounds. If the
vagueness doctrine has any basis in the original meaning
of the Due Process Clause, it must be limited to case-by­
case challenges to particular applications of a statute.
That is what early American courts did when they applied
the rule of lenity. See id., at ___ (slip op., at 10). And that
is how early American courts addressed constitutional
challenges to statutes more generally. See ibid. (“[T]here
is good evidence that [antebellum] courts . . . understood
judicial review to consist ‘of a refusal to give a statute
effect as operative law in resolving a case,’ a notion quite
distinct from our modern practice of ‘ “strik[ing] down”
legislation’ ” (quoting Walsh, Partial Unconstitutionality,
85 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 738, 756 (2010)).
                               2
   This Court’s precedents likewise recognize that, outside
the First Amendment context, a challenger must prove
that the statute is vague as applied to him. See Holder v.
Humanitarian Law Project, 561 U. S. 1, 18–19 (2010);
United States v. Williams, 553 U. S. 285, 304 (2008);
Maynard, 486 U. S., at 361; Hoffman Estates v. Flipside,
Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U. S. 489, 495, and n. 7 (1982)
(collecting cases). Johnson did not overrule these prece­
dents. While Johnson weakened the principle that a facial
challenge requires a statute to be vague “in all applica­
tions,” 576 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11) (emphasis added),
it did not address whether a statute must be vague as
applied to the person challenging it. That question did not
arise because the Court concluded that ACCA’s residual

                    THOMAS, J., dissenting

clause was vague as applied to the crime at issue there:
unlawful possession of a short-barreled shotgun. See id.,
at ___ (slip op., at 9).
   In my view, §16(b) is not vague as applied to respond­
ent. When respondent committed his burglaries in 2007
and 2009, he was “sufficiently forewarned . . . that the
statutory consequence . . . is deportation.” De George, 341
U. S., at 232. At the time, courts had “unanimous[ly]”
concluded that residential burglary is a crime of violence,
and not “a single opinion . . . ha[d] held that [it] is not.”
United States v. M. C. E., 232 F. 3d 1252, 1255–1256 (CA9
2000); see also United States v. Davis, 881 F. 2d 973, 976
(CA11 1989) (explaining that treating residential burglary
as a crime of violence was “[i]n accord with common law
tradition and the settled law of the federal circuits”).
Residential burglary “ha[d] been considered a violent
offense for hundreds of years . . . because of the potential
for mayhem if burglar encounters resident.” United States
v. Pinto, 875 F. 2d 143, 144 (CA7 1989). The Model Penal
Code had recognized that risk, see ALI, Model Penal Code
§221.1, Comment 3(c), p. 75 (1980); the Sentencing Com­
mission had recognized that risk; see United States Sen­
tencing Commission, Guidelines Manual §4B1.2(a)(2)
(Nov. 2006); and this Court had repeatedly recognized that
risk, see, e.g., James v. United States, 550 U. S. 192, 203
(2007); Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575, 588 (1990).
In Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1 (2004), this Court unan­
imously agreed that burglary is the “classic example” of a
crime of violence under §16(b), because it “involves a
substantial risk that the burglar will use force against a
victim in completing the crime.” Id., at 10.
   That same risk is present with respect to respondent’s
statute of conviction—first-degree residential burglary,
Cal. Penal Code Ann. §§459, 460(a) (West 1999). The
California Supreme Court has explained that the State’s
burglary laws recognize “the dangers to personal safety
18                  SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                    THOMAS, J., dissenting

created by the usual burglary situation.” People v. Davis,
18 Cal. 4th 712, 721, 958 P. 2d 1083, 1089 (1998) (empha­
sis added). “ ‘[T]he fact that a building is used as a home
. . . increases such danger,’ ” which is why California ele­
vates residential burglary to a first-degree offense. People
v. Rodriguez, 122 Cal. App. 4th 121, 133, 18 Cal. Rptr. 3d
550, 558 (2004); see also People v. Wilson, 208 Cal. App. 3d
611, 615, 256 Cal. Rptr. 422, 425 (1989) (“[T]he higher
degree . . . is intended to prevent those situations which
are most dangerous, most likely to cause personal injury”
(emphasis deleted)). Although unlawful entry is not an
element of the offense, courts “unanimous[ly]” agree that
the offense still involves a substantial risk of physical
force. United States v. Avila, 770 F. 3d 1100, 1106 (CA4
2014); accord, United States v. Maldonado, 696 F. 3d 1095,
1102, 1104 (CA10 2012); United States v. Scanlan, 667
F. 3d 896, 900 (CA7 2012); United States v. Echeverria–
Gomez, 627 F. 3d 971, 976 (CA5 2010); United States v.
Becker, 919 F. 2d 568, 573 (CA9 1990). First-degree resi­
dential burglary requires entry into an inhabited dwelling,
with the intent to commit a felony, against the will of the
homeowner—the key elements that create the risk of
violence. See United States v. Park, 649 F. 3d 1175, 1178–
1180 (CA9 2011); Avila, supra, at 1106–1107; Becker,
supra, at 571, n. 5. As this Court has explained, “[t]he
main risk of burglary arises not from the simple physical
act of wrongfully entering onto another’s property, but
rather from the possibility of a face-to-face confrontation
between the burglar and a third party.” James, supra, at
203.
    Drawing on Johnson and the decision below, the Court
suggests that residential burglary might not be a crime of
violence because “ ‘only about seven percent of burglaries
actually involve violence.’ ” Ante, at 9, n. 3 (citing Dimaya
v. Lynch, 803 F. 3d 1110, 1116, n. 7 (CA9 2015)); see Bu­

Victimization Survey: Victimization During Household
Burglary 1 (Sept. 2010), https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/
pdf/vdhb.pdf (as last visited Apr. 13, 2018). But this
statistic—which measures actual violence against a mem­
ber of the household, see id., at 1, 12—is woefully underin­
clusive. It excludes other potential victims besides house­
hold members—for example, “a police officer, or a
bystande[r] who comes to investigate,” James, supra, at
203. And §16(b) requires only a risk of physical force, not
actual physical force, and that risk would seem to be
present whenever someone is home during the burglary.
Further, Johnson is not conclusive because, unlike ACCA’s
residual clause, §16(b) covers offenses that involve a sub­
stantial risk of physical force “against the person or prop-
erty of another.” (Emphasis added.) Surely the ordinary
case of residential burglary involves at least one of these
risks. According to the statistics referenced by the Court,
most burglaries involve either a forcible entry (e.g., break­
ing a window or slashing a door screen), an attempted
forcible entry, or an unlawful entry when someone is
home. See Bureau of Justice Statistics, supra, at 2 (Table
1). Thus, under any metric, respondent’s convictions for
first-degree residential burglary are crimes of violence
under §16(b).
                                3
    Finally, if facial vagueness challenges are ever appro­
priate, I adhere to my view that a law is not facially vague
“ ‘[i]f any fool would know that a particular category of
conduct would be within the reach of the statute, if there
is an unmistakable core that a reasonable person would
know is forbidden by the law.’ ” Morales, 527 U. S., at 112
(THOMAS, J., dissenting) (quoting Kolender, 461 U. S., at
370–371 (White, J., dissenting)). The residual clause of
ACCA had such a core. See Johnson, 576 U. S., at ___
(slip op., at 10); id., at ___–___ (ALITO, J., dissenting) (slip
20                  SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                    THOMAS, J., dissenting

op., at 14–15). And §16(b) has an even wider core, as THE
CHIEF JUSTICE explains. Thus, the Court should not have
invalidated §16(b), either on its face or as applied to
respondent.
                              II
   Even taking the vagueness doctrine and Johnson at face
value, I disagree with the Court’s decision to invalidate
§16(b). The sole reason that the Court deems §16(b) un­
constitutionally vague is because it reads the statute as
incorporating the categorical approach—specifically, the
“ordinary case” approach from ACCA’s residual clause.
Although the Court mentions “[t]wo features” of §16(b)
that make it vague—the ordinary-case approach and an
imprecise risk standard—the Court admits that the sec­
ond feature is problematic only in combination with the
first. Ante, at 8. Without the ordinary-case approach, the
Court “do[es] not doubt” the constitutionality of §16(b).
Ante, at 10.
   But if the categorical approach renders §16(b) unconsti­
tutionally vague, then constitutional avoidance requires
us to make a reasonable effort to avoid that interpretation.
And a reasonable alternative interpretation is available:
Instead of asking whether the ordinary case of an alien’s
offense presents a substantial risk of physical force, courts
should ask whether the alien’s actual underlying conduct
presents a substantial risk of physical force. I will briefly
discuss the origins of the categorical approach and then
explain why the Court should abandon it for §16(b).
                            A
                             1
  The categorical approach originated with Justice
Blackmun’s opinion for the Court in Taylor v. United
States, 495 U. S. 575 (1990). The question in Taylor was
whether ACCA’s reference to “burglary” meant burglary
                 Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)           21

                    THOMAS, J., dissenting

as defined by state law or burglary in the generic sense.
After “devoting 10 pages of [its] opinion to legislative
history,” id., at 603 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and
concurring in judgment), and finding that Congress had
made “an inadvertent casualty in [the] complex drafting
process,” id., at 589–590 (majority opinion), the Court
concluded that ACCA referred to burglary in the generic
sense, id., at 598. The Court then addressed how the
Government would prove that a defendant was convicted
of generic burglary, as opposed to another offense. Id., at
599–602. Taylor rejected the notion that the Government
could introduce evidence about the “particular facts” of the
defendant’s underlying crime. Id., at 600. Instead, the
Court adopted a “categorical approach,” which focused
primarily on the “statutory definition of the prior offense.”
Id., at 602.
  Although Taylor was interpreting one of ACCA’s enu­
merated offenses, this Court later extended the categorical
approach to ACCA’s residual clause. See James, 550
U. S., at 208. That extension required some reworking.
Because ACCA’s enumerated-offenses clause asks whether
a prior conviction “is burglary, arson, or extortion,” 18
U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(ii), Taylor instructed courts to focus
on the definition of the underlying crime. The residual
clause, by contrast, asks whether a prior conviction “in­
volves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of
physical injury to another.” §924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Thus, the
Court held that the categorical approach for the residual
clause asks “whether the conduct encompassed by the
elements of the offense, in the ordinary case, presents a
serious potential risk of injury to another.” James, supra,
at 208 (emphasis added). This “ordinary case” approach
allowed courts to apply the residual clause without inquir­
ing into the individual facts of the defendant’s prior crime.
  Taylor gave a few reasons why the categorical approach
was the correct reading of ACCA, see 495 U. S., at 600–
22                  SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                    THOMAS, J., dissenting

601, but the “heart of the decision” was the Court’s con­
cern with limiting the amount of evidence that the parties
could introduce at sentencing. Shepard v. United States,
544 U. S. 13, 23 (2005). Specifically, the Court was wor­
ried about potential violations of the Sixth Amendment. If
the parties could introduce evidence about the defendant’s
underlying conduct, then sentencing proceedings might
devolve into a full-blown minitrial, with factfinding by the
judge instead of the jury. See id., at 24–26; Taylor, supra,
at 601. While this Court’s decision in Almendarez-Torres
v. United States, 523 U. S. 224 (1998), allows judges to
find facts about a defendant’s prior convictions, a full-
blown minitrial would look “too much like” the kind of
factfinding that the Sixth Amendment requires the jury to
conduct. Shepard, 544 U. S., at 25. By construing ACCA
to require a categorical approach, then, the Court was
following “[t]he rule of reading statutes to avoid serious
risks of unconstitutionality.” Ibid.
                              2
  I disagreed with the Court’s decision to extend the
categorical approach to ACCA’s residual clause. See
James, 550 U. S., at 231–232 (dissenting opinion). The
categorical approach was an “ ‘unnecessary exercise,’ ” I
explained, because it created the same Sixth Amendment
problem that it tried to avoid. Id., at 231. Absent waiver,
a defendant has the right to have a jury find “every fact
that is by law a basis for imposing or increasing punish­
ment,” including the fact of a prior conviction. Apprendi v.
New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 501 (2000) (THOMAS, J., concur­
ring). The exception recognized in Almendarez-Torres for
prior convictions is an aberration, has been seriously
undermined by subsequent precedents, and should be
reconsidered. See Mathis v. United States, 579 U. S. ___,
___ (2016) (THOMAS, J., concurring) (slip op., at 1); Shep-
ard, supra, at 27–28 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and

                         THOMAS, J., dissenting

concurring in judgment). In my view, if the Government
wants to enhance a defendant’s sentence based on his
prior convictions, it must put those convictions in the
indictment and prove them to a jury beyond a reasonable
doubt.6
                              B
  My objection aside, the ordinary-case approach soon
created problems of its own. The Court’s attempt to avoid
the Scylla of the Sixth Amendment steered it straight into
the Charybdis of the Fifth. The ordinary-case approach
that was created to honor the individual right to a jury is
now, according to the Court, so vague that it deprives
individuals of due process.
  I see no good reason for the Court to persist in reading
the ordinary-case approach into §16(b). The text of §16(b)
does not mandate the ordinary-case approach, the con­
cerns that led this Court to adopt it do not apply here, and
there are no prudential reasons for retaining it. In my
view, we should abandon the categorical approach for
§16(b).
                          1
  The text of §16(b) does not require a categorical ap­
proach. The INA declares an alien deportable if he is

——————
   6 The Sixth Amendment is, thus, not a reason to maintain the cate­

gorical approach in criminal cases. Contra, ante, at 13–14 (plurality
opinion). Even if it were, the Sixth Amendment does not apply in
immigration cases like this one. See Part II–B–2, infra. The plurality
contends that, if it must contort the text of §16(b) to avoid a Sixth
Amendment problem in criminal cases, then it must also contort the
text of §16(b) in immigration cases, even though the Sixth Amendment
problem does not arise in the immigration context. See ante, at 13–14,
15. But, as I have explained elsewhere, this “lowest common denomi­
nator” approach to constitutional avoidance is both ahistorical and
illogical. See Clark v. Martinez, 543 U. S. 371, 395–401 (2005) (dissent­
ing opinion).

“convicted of an aggravated felony” after he is admitted to
the United States. 8 U. S. C. §1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). Aggra­
vated felonies include “crime[s] of violence” as defined in
§16. §1101(a)(43)(F). Section 16, in turn, defines crimes of
violence as follows:
        “(a) an offense that has as an element the use, at­
     tempted use, or threatened use of physical force
     against the person or property of another, or
        “(b) any other offense that is a felony and that, by
     its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical
     force against the person or property of another may be
     used in the course of committing the offense.”
   At first glance, §16(b) is not clear about the precise
question it poses. On the one hand, the statute might
refer to the metaphysical “nature” of the offense and ask
whether it ordinarily involves a substantial risk of physi­
cal force. On the other hand, the statute might refer to
the underlying facts of the offense that the offender com­
mitted; the words “by its nature,” “substantial risk,” and
“may” would mean only that an offender who engages in
risky conduct cannot benefit from the fortuitous fact that
physical force was not actually used during his offense.
The text can bear either interpretation. See Nijhawan v.
Holder, 557 U. S. 29, 33–34 (2009) (“[I]n ordinary speech
words such as ‘crime,’ ‘felony,’ ‘offense,’ and the like some­
times refer to a generic crime . . . and sometimes refer to
the specific acts in which an offender engaged on a specific
occasion”). It is entirely natural to use words like “nature”
and “offense” to refer to an offender’s actual underlying
conduct.7

  Although both interpretations are linguistically possi­
ble, several factors indicate that the underlying-conduct
approach is the better one. To begin, §16(b) asks whether
an offense “involves” a substantial risk of force. The word
“involves” suggests that the offense must necessarily
include a substantial risk of force. See The New Oxford
Dictionary of English 962 (2001) (“include (something) as a
necessary part or result”); Random House Dictionary of
the English Language 1005 (2d ed. 1987) (“1. to include as

a necessary circumstance, condition, or consequence”);
Oxford American Dictionary 349 (1980) (“1. to contain
within itself, to make necessary as a condition or result”).
That condition is always satisfied if the Government must
prove that the alien’s underlying conduct involves a sub­
stantial risk of force, but it is not always satisfied if the
Government need only prove that the “ordinary case”
involves such a risk. See Johnson, 576 U. S., at ___
(ALITO, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 12). Tellingly, the other
aggravated felonies in the INA that use the word “in­
volves” employ the underlying-conduct approach. See 8
U. S. C. §1101(a)(43)(M)(i) (“an offense that involves fraud
or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds
$10,000”); §1101(h)(3) (“any crime of reckless driving or of
driving while intoxicated or under the influence of alcohol
or of prohibited substances if such crime involves personal
injury to another”). As do the similarly worded provisions
of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, the bill
that contained §16(b). See, e.g., 98 Stat. 2059 (elevating
the burden of proof for the release of “a person found not
guilty only by reason of insanity of an offense involving
bodily injury to, or serious damage to the property of,
another person, or involving a substantial risk of such
injury or damage”); id., at 2068 (establishing the sentence
for drug offenses “involving” specific quantities and types
of drugs); id., at 2137 (defining violent crimes in aid of
racketeering to include “attempting or conspiring to com­
mit a crime involving maiming, assault with a dangerous
weapon, or assault resulting in serious bodily injury”).
  A comparison of §16(b) and §16(a) further highlights
why the former likely adopts an underlying-conduct ap­
proach. Section 16(a) covers offenses that have the use,
attempted use, or threatened use of physical force “as an
element.” Because §16(b) covers “other” offenses and is
separated from §16(a) by the disjunctive word “or,” the
natural inference is that §16(b) asks a different question.
                 Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)           27

                    THOMAS, J., dissenting

In other words, §16(b) must require immigration judges to
look beyond the elements of an offense to determine
whether it involves a substantial risk of physical force.
But if the elements are insufficient, where else should
immigration judges look to determine the riskiness of an
offense? Two options are possible, only one of which is
workable.
   The first option is to consult the underlying facts of the
alien’s crime and then assess its riskiness. This approach
would provide a definitive answer in every case. And
courts are already familiar with this kind of inquiry. Cf.
Johnson, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 12) (noting that “doz­
ens” of similarly worded laws ask courts to assess “the
riskiness of conduct in which an individual defendant
engages on a particular occasion”). Nothing suggests that
Congress imposed a more limited inquiry when it enacted
§16(b) in 1984. At the time, Congress had not yet enacted
ACCA’s residual clause, this Court had not yet created the
categorical approach, and this Court had not yet recog­
nized a Sixth Amendment limit on judicial factfinding at
sentencing, see Chambers v. United States, 555 U. S. 122,
132 (2009) (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment).
   The second option is to imagine the “ordinary case” of
the alien’s crime and then assess the riskiness of that
hypothetical offense. But the phrase “ordinary case” does
not appear in the statute. And imagining the ordinary
case, the Court reminds us, is “hopeless[ly] indetermi­
na[te],” “wholly ‘speculative,’ ” and mere “guesswork.”
Ante, at 7, 24 (quoting Johnson, supra, at ___–___ (slip op.,
at 5, 7)); see also Chambers, supra, at 133 (opinion of
ALITO, J.) (observing that the categorical approach is
“nearly impossible to apply consistently”). Because courts
disfavor interpretations that make a statute impossible to
apply, see A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law 63 (2012),
this Court should reject the ordinary-case approach for
§16(b) and adopt the underlying-facts approach instead.
28                  SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                     THOMAS, J., dissenting

See Johnson, supra, at ___ (ALITO, J., dissenting) (slip op.,
at 10) (“When another interpretation is ready at hand,
why should we assume that Congress gave the clause a
meaning that is impossible—or even, exceedingly diffi­
cult—to apply”).
                              2
   That the categorical approach is not the better reading
of §16(b) should not be surprising, since the categorical
approach was never really about the best reading of the
text. As explained, this Court adopted that approach to
avoid a potential Sixth Amendment problem with sentenc­
ing judges conducting minitrials to determine a defend­
ant’s past conduct. But even assuming the categorical
approach solved this Sixth Amendment problem in crimi­
nal cases, no such problem arises in immigration cases.
“[T]he provisions of the Constitution securing the right of
trial by jury have no application” in a removal proceeding.
Turner, 194 U. S., at 290. And, in criminal cases, the
underlying-conduct approach would be perfectly constitu­
tional if the Government included the defendant’s prior
conduct in the indictment, tried it to a jury, and proved it
beyond a reasonable doubt. See Johnson, 576 U. S., at ___
(ALITO, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 12). Nothing in §16(b)
prohibits the Government from proceeding this way, so the
plurality is wrong to suggest that the underlying-conduct
approach would necessarily “ping-pong us from one consti­
tutional issue to another.” Ante, at 14.
   If constitutional avoidance applies here at all, it re­
quires us to reject the categorical approach for §16(b).
According to the Court, the categorical approach is uncon­
stitutionally vague. And, all agree that the underlying-
conduct approach would not be. See Johnson, 576 U. S., at
___ (majority opinion) (slip op., at 12) (“[W]e do not doubt
the constitutionality of laws that call for the application of
a qualitative standard such as ‘substantial risk’ to real­
                  Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)           29

                     THOMAS, J., dissenting

world conduct”). Thus, if the underlying-conduct approach
is a “reasonabl[e]” interpretation of §16(b), it is our “plain
duty” to adopt it. United States ex rel. Attorney General v.
Delaware & Hudson Co., 213 U. S. 366, 407 (1909). And it
is reasonable, as explained above.
   In Johnson, the Court declined to adopt the underlying-
conduct approach for ACCA’s residual clause. See 576
U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 12–13). The Court concluded
that the categorical approach was the only reasonable
reading of ACCA because the residual clause uses the
word “convictions.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 13). The Court
also stressed the “utter impracticability of requiring a
sentencing court to reconstruct, long after the original
conviction, the conduct underlying that conviction.” Ibid.
   Neither of these arguments is persuasive with respect to
the INA. Moreover, this Court has already rejected them.
In Nijhawan, this Court unanimously concluded that one
of the aggravated felonies in the INA—“an offense that . . .
involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or
victims exceeds $10,000,” §1101(a)(43)(M)(i)—applies the
underlying-conduct approach, not the categorical ap­
proach. 557 U. S., at 32. Although the INA also refers to
“convict[ions],” §1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), the Court was not
swayed by that argument. The word “convict[ion]” means
only that the defendant’s underlying conduct must “ ‘be
tied to the specific counts covered by the conviction,’ ” not
“acquitted or dismissed counts or general conduct.” Id., at
42. As for the supposed practical problems with proving
an alien’s prior conduct, the Court did not find that argu­
ment persuasive either. “[T]he ‘sole purpose’ of the ‘ag­
gravated felony’ inquiry,” the Court explained, “ ‘is to
ascertain the nature of a prior conviction; it is not an
invitation to relitigate the conviction itself.’ ” Ibid. And
because the INA places the burden on the Government to
prove an alien’s conduct by clear and convincing evidence,
§1229a(c)(3)(A), “uncertainties caused by the passage of
30                   SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                     THOMAS, J., dissenting

time are likely to count in the alien’s favor,” id., at 42.
   There are additional reasons why the practical problems
identified in Johnson should not matter for §16(b)—even
assuming they should have mattered for ACCA’s residual
clause, see Lewis v. Chicago, 560 U. S. 205, 217 (2010)
(“[I]t is not our task to assess the consequences of each
approach and adopt the one that produces the least mis­
chief. Our charge is to give effect to the law Congress
enacted”). In a removal proceeding, any difficulties with
identifying an alien’s past conduct will fall on immigration
judges, not federal courts. But those judges are already
accustomed to finding facts about the conduct underlying
an alien’s prior convictions, since some of the INA’s aggra­
vated felonies employ the underlying-conduct approach.
The BIA has instructed immigration judges to determine
such conduct based on “any evidence admissible in re-
moval proceedings,” not just the elements of the offense or the
record of conviction. See Matter of Babaisakov, 24 I. & N.
Dec. 306, 307 (2007). No one has submitted any evidence
that the BIA’s approach has been “utter[ly] impracti­
cab[le]” or “daunting[ly] difficul[t]” in practice. Ante, at
15. And even if it were, “how much time the agency wants
to devote to the resolution of particular issues is . . . a
question for the agency itself.” Ali v. Mukasey, 521 F. 3d
737, 741 (CA7 2008). Hypothetical burdens on the BIA
should not influence how this Court interprets §16(b).
   In short, we should not blithely assume that the reasons
why this Court adopted the categorical approach for
ACCA’s residual clause also apply to the INA’s list of
aggravated felonies. As Nijhawan explained, “the ‘aggra­
vated felony’ statute, unlike ACCA, contains some lan­
guage that refers to generic crimes and some language
that almost certainly refers to the specific circumstances
in which a crime was committed.” 557 U. S., at 38. “The
question” in each case is “to which category [the aggra-
vated felony] belongs.” Ibid. As I have explained, §16(b)
                 Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)           31

                    THOMAS, J., dissenting

belongs in the underlying-conduct category. Because that
is the better reading of §16(b)’s text—or at least a reason­
able reading—the Court should have adopted it here.
                               3
   I see no prudential reason for maintaining the categori­
cal approach for §16(b). The Court notes that the Gov­
ernment “explicitly acknowledges” that §16(b) employs the
categorical approach. Ante, at 9. But we cannot permit
the Government’s concessions to dictate how we interpret
a statute, much less cause us to invalidate a statute en­
acted by a coordinate branch. See United States Nat.
Bank of Ore. v. Independent Ins. Agents of America, Inc.,
508 U. S. 439, 446–447 (1993); Young v. United States, 315
U. S. 257, 258–259 (1942). This Court’s “traditional prac­
tice” is to “refus[e] to decide constitutional questions”
when other grounds of decision are available, “whether or
not they have been properly raised before us by the par­
ties.” Neese v. Southern R. Co., 350 U. S. 77, 78 (1955)
(per curiam); see also Vermeule, Saving Constructions, 85
Geo. L. J. 1945, 1948–1949 (1997) (explaining that courts
commonly “decide an antecedent statutory issue, even one
waived by the parties, if its resolution could preclude a
constitutional claim”). This Court has raised potential
saving constructions “on our own motion” when they could
avoid a ruling on constitutional vagueness grounds, even
in cases where the Government was a party. United
States v. L. Cohen Grocery Co., 255 U. S. 81, 88 (1921).
We should have followed that established practice here.
   Nor should stare decisis prevent us from rejecting the
categorical approach for §16(b). This Court has never held
that §16(b) incorporates the ordinary-case approach.
Although Leocal held that §16(b) incorporates a version of
the categorical approach, the Court must not feel bound by
that decision, as it largely overrules it today. See ante, at
22, n. 7. Surely the Court cannot credibly invoke stare
32                  SESSIONS v. DIMAYA

                     THOMAS, J., dissenting

decisis to defend the categorical approach—the same
approach it says only a “lunatic” would continue to apply.
Ante, at 24. If the Court views the categorical approach
that way—the same way Johnson viewed it—then it must
also agree that “[s]tanding by [the categorical approach]
would undermine, rather than promote, the goals that
stare decisis is meant to serve.” 576 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,
at 15). That is especially true if the Court’s decision leads
to the invalidation of scores of similarly worded state and
federal statutes, which seems even more likely after today
than it did after Johnson. Instead of adhering to an inter­
pretation that it thinks unconstitutional and then using
that interpretation to strike down another statute, the
Court should have taken this opportunity to abandon the
categorical approach for §16(b) once and for all.
                          *    *   *
  The Court’s decision today is triply flawed. It unneces­
sarily extends our incorrect decision in Johnson. It uses a
constitutional doctrine with dubious origins to invalidate
yet another statute (while calling into question countless
more). And it does all this in the name of a statutory
interpretation that we should have discarded long ago.
Because I cannot follow the Court down any of these rab­
bit holes, I respectfully dissent.

           APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT

                                   [April 17, 2018] 


   PER CURIAM.
   The Court granted certiorari in this case to decide
whether, when the Government has obtained a warrant
under </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">18</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §2703, a U. S. provider of e-mail services
must disclose to the Government electronic communica-
tions within its control even if the provider stores the
communications abroad. 583 U. S. ___ (2017).
   In December 2013, federal law enforcement agents
applied to the United States District Court for the South-
ern District of New York for a §2703 warrant requiring
Microsoft to disclose all e-mails and other information
associated with the account of one of its customers. Satis-
fied that the agents had demonstrated probable cause to
believe that the account was being used to further illegal
drug trafficking, a Magistrate Judge issued the requested
§2703 warrant. App. 22–26. The warrant directed Mi-
crosoft to disclose to the Government the contents of a
specified e-mail account and all other records or infor-
mation associated with the account “[t]o the extent that
the information . . . is within [Microsoft’s] possession,
custody, or control.” Id., at 24.
2           UNITED STATES v. MICROSOFT CORP.

                         Per Curiam

   After service of the §2703 warrant, Microsoft deter-
mined that the account’s e-mail contents were stored in a
sole location: Microsoft’s datacenter in Dublin, Ireland.
Id., at 34. Microsoft moved to quash the warrant with
respect to the information stored in Ireland. The Magis-
trate Judge denied Microsoft’s motion. In re Warrant To
Search a Certain E-Mail Account Controlled and Main-
tained by Microsoft Corp., </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">15</span> <span class=""reporter"">F. Supp. 3d</span> <span class=""page"">466</span></span><pre class=""inline""> (SDNY 2014).
The District Court, after a hearing, adopted the Magis-
trate Judge’s reasoning and affirmed his ruling. See In re
Warrant To Search a Certain E-Mail Account Controlled
and Maintained by Microsoft Corp., </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">829</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.3d</span> <span class=""page"">197</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 204–
205 (CA2 2016). Soon after, acting on a stipulation sub-
mitted jointly by the parties, the District Court held Mi-
crosoft in civil contempt for refusing to comply fully with
the warrant. Id., at 205. On appeal, a panel of the Court
of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the denial of the
motion to quash and vacated the civil contempt finding,
holding that requiring Microsoft to disclose the electronic
communications in question would be an unauthorized
extraterritorial application of §2703. Id., at 222.
   The parties now advise us that on March 23, 2018,
Congress enacted and the President signed into law the
Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act (CLOUD Act),
as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, Pub.
L. 115–141. The CLOUD Act amends the Stored Commu-
nications Act, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">18</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §2701 et seq., by adding the
following provision:
    “A [service provider] shall comply with the obligations
    of this chapter to preserve, backup, or disclose the
    contents of a wire or electronic communication and
    any record or other information pertaining to a cus-
    tomer or subscriber within such provider’s possession,
    custody, or control, regardless of whether such com-
    munication, record, or other information is located

    within or outside of the United States.” CLOUD Act
    §103(a)(1).
Soon thereafter, the Government obtained, pursuant to
the new law, a new §2703 warrant covering the infor-
mation requested in the §2703 warrant at issue in this
case.
  No live dispute remains between the parties over the
issue with respect to which certiorari was granted. See
Department of Treasury, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms v. Galioto, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""111729""><a href=""/opinion/111729/department-of-treasury-bureau-of-alcohol-tobacco-and-firearms-v-galioto/""><span class=""volume"">477</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">556</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 559 (1986). Further,
the parties agree that the new warrant has replaced the
original warrant. This case, therefore, has become moot.
Following the Court’s established practice in such cases,
the judgment on review is accordingly vacated, and the
case is remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit with instructions first to vacate the
District Court’s contempt finding and its denial of Mi-
crosoft’s motion to quash, then to direct the District Court
to dismiss the case as moot.
                                             It is so ordered.

and Maintained by Microsoft Corp., 829 F. 3d 197, 204–
205 (CA2 2016). Soon after, acting on a stipulation sub-
mitted jointly by the parties, the District Court held Mi-
crosoft in civil contempt for refusing to comply fully with
the warrant. Id., at 205. On appeal, a panel of the Court
of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the denial of the
motion to quash and vacated the civil contempt finding,
holding that requiring Microsoft to disclose the electronic
communications in question would be an unauthorized
extraterritorial application of §2703. Id., at 222.
   The parties now advise us that on March 23, 2018,
Congress enacted and the President signed into law the
Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act (CLOUD Act),
as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, Pub.
L. 115–141. The CLOUD Act amends the Stored Commu-
nications Act, 18 U. S. C. §2701 et seq., by adding the
following provision:
    “A [service provider] shall comply with the obligations
    of this chapter to preserve, backup, or disclose the
    contents of a wire or electronic communication and
    any record or other information pertaining to a cus-
    tomer or subscriber within such provider’s possession,
    custody, or control, regardless of whether such com-
    munication, record, or other information is located

    within or outside of the United States.” CLOUD Act
    §103(a)(1).
Soon thereafter, the Government obtained, pursuant to
the new law, a new §2703 warrant covering the infor-
mation requested in the §2703 warrant at issue in this
case.
  No live dispute remains between the parties over the
issue with respect to which certiorari was granted. See
Department of Treasury, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms v. Galioto, 477 U. S. 556, 559 (1986). Further,
the parties agree that the new warrant has replaced the
original warrant. This case, therefore, has become moot.
Following the Court’s established practice in such cases,
the judgment on review is accordingly vacated, and the
case is remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit with instructions first to vacate the
District Court’s contempt finding and its denial of Mi-
crosoft’s motion to quash, then to direct the District Court
to dismiss the case as moot.
                                             It is so ordered.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT

    No. 16–6855.      Argued October 30, 2017—Decided April 17, 2018
Petitioner Marion Wilson was convicted of murder and sentenced to
  death. He sought habeas relief in Georgia Superior Court, claiming
  that his counsel’s ineffectiveness during sentencing violated the Sixth
  Amendment. The court denied the petition, in relevant part, because
  it concluded that counsel’s performance was not deficient and had not
  prejudiced Wilson. The Georgia Supreme Court summarily denied
  his application for a certificate of probable cause to appeal. Wilson
  subsequently filed a federal habeas petition, raising the same ineffec-
  tive-assistance claim. The District Court assumed that his counsel
  was deficient but deferred to the state habeas court’s conclusion that
  any deficiencies did not prejudice Wilson. The Eleventh Circuit af-
  firmed. First, however, the panel concluded that the District Court
  was wrong to “look though” the State Supreme Court’s unexplained
  decision and assume that it rested on the grounds given in the state
  habeas court’s opinion, rather than ask what arguments “could have
  supported” the State Supreme Court’s summary decision. The en
  banc court agreed with the panel’s methodology.
Held: A federal habeas court reviewing an unexplained state-court de-
 cision on the merits should “look through” that decision to the last re-
 lated state-court decision that provides a relevant rationale and pre-
 sume that the unexplained decision adopted the same reasoning.
 The State may rebut the presumption by showing that the unex-
 plained decision most likely relied on different grounds than the rea-
 soned decision below. Pp. 5–11.
    (a) In Ylst v. Nunnemaker, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""112642""><a href=""/opinion/112642/ylst-v-nunnemaker/""><span class=""volume"">501</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">797</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, the Court held that
 where there has been one reasoned state judgment rejecting a federal
 claim, later unexplained orders upholding that judgment or rejecting
 the same claim are presumed to rest upon the same ground. In Ylst,
2                          WILSON v. SELLERS

                                  Syllabus

    where the last reasoned opinion on the claim explicitly imposed a
    procedural default, the Court presumed that a later decision rejecting
    the claim did not silently disregard that bar and consider the merits.
       Since Ylst, every Circuit to have considered the matter, but for the
    Eleventh Circuit, has applied a “look through” presumption even
    where the state courts did not apply a procedural bar to review, and
    most Circuits applied the presumption prior to Ylst. The presump-
    tion is often realistic, for state higher courts often issue summary de-
    cisions when they have examined the lower court’s reasoning and
    found nothing significant with which they disagree. The presump-
    tion also is often more efficiently applied than a contrary approach
    that would require a federal court to imagine what might have been
    the state court’s supportive reasoning.
       The State argues that Harrington v. Richter, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""182992""><a href=""/opinion/182992/harrington-v-richter/""><span class=""volume"">562</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">86</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, controls
    here and that Ylst should apply, at most, where the federal habeas
    court is trying to determine whether a state-court decision without
    opinion rested on a state procedural ground or whether the state
    court reached the merits of a federal issue. Richter, however, did not
    directly concern the issue in this case—whether to “look through” the
    silent state higher court opinion to the lower court’s reasoned opinion
    in order to determine the reasons for the higher court’s decision. In
    Richter, there was no lower court opinion to look to. And Richter does
    not say that Ylst’s reasoning does not apply in the context of an un-
    explained decision on the merits. Indeed, this Court has “looked
    though” to lower court decisions in cases involving the merits. See,
    e.g., Premo v. Moore, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""182991""><a href=""/opinion/182991/premo-v-moore/""><span class=""volume"">562</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">115</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 123–133. Pp. 5–9.
       (b) The State’s further arguments are unconvincing. It points out
    that the “look though” presumption may not accurately identify the
    grounds for a higher court’s decision. But the “look through” pre-
    sumption is not an absolute rule. Additional evidence that might not
    be sufficient to rebut the presumption in a case like Ylst, where the
    lower court rested on a state-law procedural ground, would allow a
    federal court to conclude that counsel has rebutted the presumption
    in a case decided on the merits. For instance, a federal court may
    conclude that the presumption is rebutted where counsel identifies
    convincing alternative arguments for affirmance that were made to
    the State’s highest court, or equivalent evidence such as an alterna-
    tive ground that is obvious in the state-court record. The State also
    argues that this Court does not necessarily presume that a federal
    court of appeals’ silent opinion adopts the reasoning of the court be-
    low, but that is a different context. Were there to be a “look through”
    approach as a general matter in that context, judges and lawyers
    might read those decisions as creating, through silence, binding cir-
    cuit precedent. Here, a federal court “looks through” the silent deci-

  sion for a specific and narrow purpose, to identify the grounds for the
  higher court’s decision as the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Pen-
  alty Act requires. Nor does the “look through” approach show disre-
  spect for the States; rather, it seeks to replicate the grounds for the
  higher state court’s decision. Finally, the “look though” approach is
  unlikely to lead state courts to write full opinions where they would
  have preferred to decide summarily, at least not to any significant
  degree. Pp. 9–11.

  MARION WILSON, PETITIONER v. ERIC SELLERS,
                  WARDEN
 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT
                                 [April 17, 2018]

   JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.
   The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of
1996 (AEDPA) requires a prisoner who challenges (in a
federal habeas court) a matter “adjudicated on the merits
in State court” to show that the relevant state-court “deci-
sion” (1) “was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable
application of, clearly established Federal law,” or (2) “was
based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in
light of the evidence presented in the State court proceed-
ing.” </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">28</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §2254(d). Deciding whether a state
court’s decision “involved” an unreasonable application of
federal law or “was based on” an unreasonable determina-
tion of fact requires the federal habeas court to “train its
attention on the particular reasons—both legal and fac-
tual—why state courts rejected a state prisoner’s federal
claims,” Hittson v. Chatman, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">576</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">___, ___ (2015)
(GINSBURG, J., concurring in denial of certiorari) (slip op.,
at 1), and to give appropriate deference to that decision,
Harrington v. Richter, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""182992""><a href=""/opinion/182992/harrington-v-richter/""><span class=""volume"">562</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">86</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 101–102 (2011).
   This is a straightforward inquiry when the last state
court to decide a prisoner’s federal claim explains its
2                   WILSON v. SELLERS

                     Opinion of the Court

decision on the merits in a reasoned opinion. In that case,
a federal habeas court simply reviews the specific reasons
given by the state court and defers to those reasons if they
are reasonable. We have affirmed this approach time and
again. See, e.g., Porter v. McCollum, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""1756""><a href=""/opinion/1756/porter-v-mccollum/""><span class=""volume"">558</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">30</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 39–44

388–392 (2005); Wiggins v. Smith, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""130159""><a href=""/opinion/130159/wiggins-v-smith-warden/""><span class=""volume"">539</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">510</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 523–538
(2003).
   The issue before us, however, is more difficult. It con-
cerns how a federal habeas court is to find the state court’s
reasons when the relevant state-court decision on the
merits, say, a state supreme court decision, does not come
accompanied with those reasons. For instance, the deci-
sion may consist of a one-word order, such as “affirmed” or
“denied.” What then is the federal habeas court to do?
We hold that the federal court should “look through” the
unexplained decision to the last related state-court deci-
sion that does provide a relevant rationale. It should then
presume that the unexplained decision adopted the same
reasoning. But the State may rebut the presumption by
showing that the unexplained affirmance relied or most
likely did rely on different grounds than the lower state
court’s decision, such as alternative grounds for affir-
mance that were briefed or argued to the state supreme
court or obvious in the record it reviewed.
                             I
  In 1997 a Georgia jury convicted petitioner, Marion
Wilson, of murder and related crimes. After a sentencing
hearing, the jury sentenced Wilson to death. In 1999 the
Georgia Supreme Court affirmed Wilson’s conviction and
sentence, Wilson v. State, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""1270323""><a href=""/opinion/1270323/wilson-v-state/""><span class=""volume"">271</span> <span class=""reporter"">Ga.</span> <span class=""page"">811</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""1270323""><a href=""/opinion/1270323/wilson-v-state/""><span class=""volume"">525</span> <span class=""reporter"">S.E.2d</span> <span class=""page"">339</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">
(1999), and this Court denied his petition for certiorari,
Wilson v. Georgia, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">531</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">838</span></span><pre class=""inline""> (2000).
  Wilson then filed a petition for habeas corpus in a state
court, the Superior Court for Butts County. Among other
                 Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)           3

                     Opinion of the Court

things, he claimed that his counsel was “ineffective” dur-
ing his sentencing, in violation of the Sixth Amendment.
See Strickland v. Washington, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""111170""><a href=""/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/""><span class=""volume"">466</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">668</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 687 (1984)
(setting forth “two components” of an ineffective-
assistance-of-counsel claim: “that counsel’s performance
was deficient” and “that the deficient performance preju-
diced the defense”). Wilson identified new evidence that
he argued trial counsel should have introduced at sentenc-
ing, namely, testimony from various witnesses about
Wilson’s childhood and the impairment of the frontal lobe
of Wilson’s brain.
   After a hearing, the state habeas court denied the peti-
tion in relevant part because it thought Wilson’s evidence
did not show that counsel was “deficient,” and, in any
event, counsel’s failure to find and present the new evi-
dence that Wilson offered had not prejudiced Wilson.
Wilson v. Terry, No. 2001–v–38 (Super. Ct. Butts Cty.,
Ga., Dec. 1, 2008), App. 60–61. In the court’s view, that
was because the new evidence was “inadmissible on evi-
dentiary grounds,” was “cumulative of other testimony,” or
“otherwise would not have, in reasonable probability,
changed the outcome of the trial.” Id., at 61. Wilson
applied to the Georgia Supreme Court for a certificate of
probable cause to appeal the state habeas court’s decision.
But the Georgia Supreme Court denied the application
without any explanatory opinion. Wilson v. Terry, No.
2001–v–38 (May 3, 2010), App. 87, cert. denied, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">562</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span>
<span class=""page"">1093</span></span><pre class=""inline""> (2010).
   Wilson subsequently filed a petition for habeas corpus in
the United States District Court for the Middle District of
Georgia. He made what was essentially the same “ineffec-
tive assistance” claim. After a hearing, the District Court
denied Wilson’s petition. Wilson v. Humphrey, No. 5:10–
cv–489 (Dec. 19, 2013), App. 88–89. The court assumed
that Wilson’s counsel had indeed been “deficient” in failing
adequately to investigate Wilson’s background and physi-
4                   WILSON v. SELLERS

                     Opinion of the Court

cal condition for mitigation evidence and to present what
he likely would have found at the sentencing hearing. Id.,
at 144. But, the court nonetheless deferred to the state
habeas court’s conclusion that these deficiencies did not
“prejudice” Wilson, primarily because the testimony of
many witnesses was “cumulative,” and because the evi-
dence of physical impairments did not include any physi-
cal examination or other support that would have shown
the state-court determination was “unreasonable.” Id., at
187; see Richter, 562 U. S., at 111–112.
   Wilson appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Elev-
enth Circuit. Wilson v. Warden, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">774</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.3d</span> <span class=""page"">671</span></span><pre class=""inline""> (2014). The
panel first held that the District Court had used the wrong
method for determining the reasoning of the relevant state
court, namely, that of the Georgia Supreme Court (the
final and highest state court to decide the merits of Wil-
son’s claims). Id., at 678. That state-court decision, the
panel conceded, was made without an opinion. But, the
federal court was wrong to “look through” that decision
and assume that it rested on the grounds given in the
lower court’s decision. Instead of “looking through” the
decision to the state habeas court’s opinion, the federal
court should have asked what arguments “could have
supported” the Georgia Supreme Court’s refusal to grant
permission to appeal. The panel proceeded to identify a
number of bases that it believed reasonably could have
supported the decision. Id., at 678–681.
   The Eleventh Circuit then granted Wilson rehearing en
banc so that it could consider the matter of methodology.
Wilson v. Warden, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">834</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.3d</span> <span class=""page"">1227</span></span><pre class=""inline""> (2016). Ultimately six
judges (a majority) agreed with the panel and held that its
“could have supported” approach was correct. Id., at 1235.
Five dissenting judges believed that the District Court
should have used the methodology it did use, namely, the
“look through” approach. Id., at 1242–1247, 1247–1269.
Wilson then sought certiorari here. Because the Eleventh

   We conclude that federal habeas law employs a “look
through” presumption. That conclusion has parallels in
this Court’s precedent. In Ylst v. Nunnemaker, a defend-
ant, convicted in a California state court of murder, ap-
pealed his conviction to the state appeals court where he
raised a constitutional claim based on Miranda v. Arizona,
</pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""107252""><a href=""/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/""><span class=""volume"">384</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">436</span></a></span><pre class=""inline""> (1966). </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""112642""><a href=""/opinion/112642/ylst-v-nunnemaker/""><span class=""volume"">501</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">797</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 799–800 (1991). The
appeals court rejected that claim, writing that “ ‘an objec-
tion based upon a Miranda violation cannot be raised for
the first time on appeal.’ ” Id., at 799. The defendant then
similarly challenged his conviction in the California Su-
preme Court and on collateral review in several state
courts (including once again the California Supreme
Court). In each of these latter instances the state court
denied the defendant relief (or review). In each instance
the court did so without an opinion or other explanation.
Id., at 799–800.
   Subsequently, the defendant asked a federal habeas
court to review his constitutional claim. Id., at 800. The
higher state courts had given no reason for their decision.
And this Court ultimately had to decide how the federal
court was to find the state court’s reasoning in those cir-

                    Opinion of the Court

cumstances. Should it have “looked through” the unrea-
soned decisions to the state procedural ground articulated
in the appeals court or should it have used a different
method?
   In answering that question Justice Scalia wrote the
following for the Court:
    “The problem we face arises, of course, because many
    formulary orders are not meant to convey anything as
    to the reason for the decision. Attributing a reason is
    therefore both difficult and artificial. We think that
    the attribution necessary for federal habeas purposes
    can be facilitated, and sound results more often as-
    sured, by applying the following presumption: Where
    there has been one reasoned state judgment rejecting
    a federal claim, later unexplained orders upholding
    that judgment or rejecting the same claim rest upon
    the same ground. If an earlier opinion ‘fairly ap-
    pear[s] to rest primarily upon federal law,’ we will
    presume that no procedural default has been invoked
    by a subsequent unexplained order that leaves the
    judgment or its consequences in place. Similarly
    where, as here, the last reasoned opinion on the claim
    explicitly imposes a procedural default, we will pre-
    sume that a later decision rejecting the claim did not
    silently disregard that bar and consider the merits.”
    Id., at 803 (citation omitted).
  Since Ylst, every Circuit to have considered the matter
has applied this presumption, often called the “look
through” presumption, but for the Eleventh Circuit—even
where the state courts did not apply a procedural bar to
review. See supra, at 4–5. And most Federal Circuits
applied it prior to Ylst. See Ylst, supra, at 803 (citing

  That is not surprising in light of the fact that the “look
through” presumption is often realistic, for state higher
courts often (but certainly not always, see Redmon v.
Johnson, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">2018</span> <span class=""reporter"">WL</span> <span class=""page"">415714</span></span><pre class=""inline""> (Ga., Jan. 16, 2018)) write
“denied” or “affirmed” or “dismissed” when they have
examined the lower court’s reasoning and found nothing
significant with which they disagree.
  Moreover, a “look through” presumption is often (but not
always) more efficiently applied than a contrary ap-
proach—an approach, for example, that would require a
federal habeas court to imagine what might have been the
state court’s supportive reasoning. The latter task may
prove particularly difficult where the issue involves state
law, such as state procedural rules that may constrain the
scope of a reviewing court’s summary decision, a matter in
which a federal judge often lacks comparative expertise.
See Ylst, supra, at 805.
  The State points to a later case, Harrington v. Richter,
</pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""182992""><a href=""/opinion/182992/harrington-v-richter/""><span class=""volume"">562</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">86</span></a></span><pre class=""inline""> (2011), which, it says, controls here instead of
Ylst. In its view, Ylst should apply, at most, to cases in
which the federal habeas court is trying to determine
whether a state-court decision without opinion rested on a
state procedural ground (for example, a procedural de-
fault) or whether the state court has reached the merits of
a federal issue. In support, it notes that Richter held that
the state-court decisions to which AEDPA refers include
summary dispositions, i.e., decisions without opinion.
Richter added that “determining whether a state court’s
decision resulted from an unreasonable legal or factual
conclusion does not require that there be an opinion from
the state court explaining the state court’s reasoning.”
562 U. S., at 98.
  Richter then said that, where “a state court’s decision is
unaccompanied by an explanation, the habeas petitioner’s
burden still must be met by showing there was no reason-
8                   WILSON v. SELLERS

                     Opinion of the Court

able basis for the state court to deny relief.” Ibid. And the
Court concluded that, when “a federal claim has been
presented to a state court and the state court has denied
relief, it may be presumed that the state court adjudicated
the claim on the merits in the absence of any indication or
state-law procedural principles to the contrary.” Id., at 99.
   In our view, however, Richter does not control here. For
one thing, Richter did not directly concern the issue before
us—whether to “look through” the silent state higher court
opinion to the reasoned opinion of a lower court in order to
determine the reasons for the higher court’s decision.
Indeed, it could not have considered that matter, for in
Richter, there was no lower court opinion to look to. That
is because the convicted defendant sought to raise his
federal constitutional claim for the first time in the Cali-
fornia Supreme Court (via a direct petition for habeas
corpus, as California law permits). Id., at 96.
   For another thing, Richter does not say the reasoning of
Ylst does not apply in the context of an unexplained deci-
sion on the merits. To the contrary, the Court noted that
it was setting forth a presumption, which “may be over-
come when there is reason to think some other explana-
tion for the state court’s decision is more likely.” Richter,
supra, at 99–100. And it referred in support to Ylst, 501
U. S., at 803.
   Further, we have “looked through” to lower court deci-
sions in cases involving the merits. See, e.g., Premo v.
Moore, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""182991""><a href=""/opinion/182991/premo-v-moore/""><span class=""volume"">562</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">115</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 123–133 (2011); Sears v. Upton,

cided one of those cases, Premo, on the same day we decided
Richter. And in our opinion in Richter we referred to
Premo. 562 U. S., at 91. Had we intended Richter’s “could
have supported” framework to apply even where there is a
reasoned decision by a lower state court, our opinion in
Premo would have looked very different. We did not even
cite the reviewing state court’s summary affirmance.
                 Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)            9

                     Opinion of the Court

Instead, we focused exclusively on the actual reasons
given by the lower state court, and we deferred to those
reasons under AEDPA. 562 U. S., at 132 (“The state
postconviction court’s decision involved no unreasonable
application of Supreme Court precedent”).
                             III
   The State’s further arguments do not convince us. The
State points out that there could be many cases in which a
“look through” presumption does not accurately identify
the grounds for the higher court’s decision. And we agree.
We also agree that it is more likely that a state supreme
court’s single word “affirm” rests upon alternative grounds
where the lower state court decision is unreasonable than,
e.g., where the lower court rested on a state-law proce-
dural ground, as in Ylst. But that is why we have set forth a
presumption and not an absolute rule. And the unreason-
ableness of the lower court’s decision itself provides some
evidence that makes it less likely the state supreme court
adopted the same reasoning. Thus, additional evidence
that might not be sufficient to rebut the presumption in a
case like Ylst would allow a federal court to conclude that
counsel has rebutted the presumption in a case like this
one. For instance, a federal habeas court may conclude
that counsel has rebutted the presumption on the basis of
convincing alternative arguments for affirmance made to
the State’s highest court or equivalent evidence presented
in its briefing to the federal court similarly establishing
that the State’s highest court relied on a different ground
than the lower state court, such as the existence of a valid
ground for affirmance that is obvious from the state-court
record. The dissent argues that the Georgia Supreme
Court’s recent decision in Redmon v. Johnson rebuts the
presumption in Georgia because that court indicated its
summary decisions should not be read to adopt the lower
court’s reasoning.      Post, at 6–8, 10–11 (opinion of
10                  WILSON v. SELLERS

                     Opinion of the Court

GORSUCH, J.). This misses the point. A presumption that
can be rebutted by evidence of, for instance, an alternative
ground that was argued or that is clear in the record was
the likely basis for the decision is in accord with full and
proper respect for state courts, like those in Georgia,
which have well-established systems and procedures in
place in order to ensure proper consideration to the argu-
ments and contention in the many cases they must process
to determine whether relief should be granted when a
criminal conviction or its ensuing sentence is challenged.
   The State also points out that we do not necessarily
presume that a silent opinion of a federal court of appeals
adopts the reasoning of the court below. The dissent
similarly invokes these “traditional rules of appellate
practice.” See post, at 5–6, 10. But neither the State nor
the dissent provides examples of similar context. Were we
to adopt a “look through” approach in respect to silent
federal appeals court decisions as a general matter in
other contexts, we would risk judges and lawyers reading
those decisions as creating, through silence, a precedent
that could be read as binding throughout the circuit—just
what a silent decision may be thought not to do. Here,
however, we “look through” the silent decision for a spe-
cific and narrow purpose—to identify the grounds for the
higher court’s decision, as AEDPA directs us to do. See
supra, at 1–2. We see no reason why the federal court’s
interpretation of the state court’s silence should be taken
as binding precedent outside this context, for example, as
a statewide binding interpretation of state law.
   Further, the State argues that the “look through” ap-
proach shows disrespect for the States. See Brief for
Respondent 39 (“Wilson’s approach to summary decisions
reflects an utter lack of faith in the ability of the highest
state courts to adjudicate constitutional rights”). We do
not believe this is so. Rather the presumption seeks to
replicate the grounds for the higher state court’s decision.
                  Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)           11

                      Opinion of the Court

Where there are convincing grounds to believe the silent
court had a different basis for its decision than the analy-
sis followed by the previous court, the federal habeas court
is free, as we have said, to find to the contrary. In our
view, this approach is more likely to respect what the
state court actually did, and easier to apply in practice,
than to ask the federal court to substitute for silence the
federal court’s thought as to more supportive reasoning.
  Finally, the State argues that the “look through” ap-
proach will lead state courts to believe they must write full
opinions where, given the workload, they would have
preferred to have decided summarily. Though the matter
is empirical, given the narrowness of the context, we do
not believe that they will feel compelled to do so—at least
not to any significant degree. The State offers no such
evidence in the many Circuits that have applied Ylst
outside the procedural context. See supra, at 5.
  For these reasons, we reverse the Eleventh Circuit’s
judgment and remand the case for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.
                                             It is so ordered.

  MARION WILSON, PETITIONER v. ERIC SELLERS,
                  WARDEN
 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT
                        [April 17, 2018]

   JUSTICE GORSUCH, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS and
JUSTICE ALITO join, dissenting.
   After a state supreme court issues a summary order
sustaining a criminal conviction, should a federal habeas
court reviewing that decision presume it rests only on the
reasons found in a lower state court opinion? The answer
is no. The statute governing federal habeas review per-
mits no such “look through” presumption. Nor do tradi-
tional principles of appellate review. In fact, we demand
the opposite presumption for our work—telling readers
that we independently review each case and that our
summary affirmances may be read only as signaling
agreement with a lower court’s judgment and not neces-
sarily its reasons. Because I can discern no good reason to
treat the work of our state court colleagues with less
respect than we demand for our own, I would reject peti-
tioner’s presumption and must respectfully dissent.
   Even so, some good news can be found here. While the
Court agrees to adopt a “look through” presumption, it
does so only after making major modifications to petition-
er’s proposal. The Court tells us that the presumption
should count for little in cases “where the lower state court
decision is unreasonable” because it is not “likely” a state
supreme court would adopt unreasonable reasoning.
Ante, at 9. In cases like that too, the Court explains,
2                   WILSON v. SELLERS

                    GORSUCH, J., dissenting

federal courts remain free to sustain state court convic-
tions whenever reasonable “ground[s] for affirmance [are]
obvious from the state-court record” or appear in the
parties’ submissions in state court or the federal habeas
proceeding. Ibid. Exactly right, and exactly what the law
has always demanded. So while the Court takes us on a
journey through novel presumptions and rebuttals, it
happily returns us in the end very nearly to the place
where we began and belonged all along.
                              *
   To see the problem with petitioner’s presumption, start
with the statute. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death
Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) governs federal review of
state criminal convictions. It says a federal court may not
grant habeas relief overturning a state court conviction
“with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the
merits in State court proceedings” unless (among other
things) the petitioner can show that the state court pro-
ceedings “resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or
involved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab-
lished Federal law.” </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">28</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §2254(d)(1). As the text
and our precedent make clear, a federal habeas court must
focus its review on the final state court decision on the
merits, not any preceding decision by an inferior state
court. See Greene v. Fisher, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""616869""><a href=""/opinion/616869/greene-v-fisher/""><span class=""volume"">565</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">34</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 40 (2011). Nor
does it matter whether the final state court decision comes
with a full opinion or in a summary order: the same defer-
ence is due all final state court decisions. Harrington v.
Richter, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""182992""><a href=""/opinion/182992/harrington-v-richter/""><span class=""volume"">562</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">86</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 98 (2011); Cullen v.

<span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">170</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 187 (2011).
   The upshot of these directions is clear. Even when the
final state court decision “is unaccompanied by an expla-
nation, the habeas petitioner’s burden still must be met by
showing there was no reasonable basis for the state court
to deny relief.” Richter, 562 U. S., at 98 (emphasis added).

                    GORSUCH, J., dissenting

And before a federal court can disregard a final summary
state court decision, it “must determine what arguments
or theories . . . could have supporte[d] the state court’s
decision; and then it must ask whether it is possible fair-
minded jurists could disagree that those arguments or
theories are inconsistent with the holding in a prior deci-
sion of this Court.” Id., at 102 (emphasis added). Far
from suggesting federal courts should presume a state
supreme court summary order rests on views expressed in
a lower court’s opinion, then, AEDPA and our precedents
require more nearly the opposite presumption: federal
courts must presume the order rests on any reasonable
basis the law and facts allow.
   If this standard seems hard for a habeas petitioner to
overcome, “that is because it was meant to be.” Ibid. In
AEDPA, Congress rejected the notion that federal habeas
review should be “a substitute for ordinary error correc-
tion.” Id., at 102–103. Instead, AEDPA “reflects the view
that habeas corpus is a ‘guard against extreme malfunc-
tions in the state criminal justice systems.’ ” Id., at 102
(emphasis added). “The reasons for this approach are
familiar. ‘Federal habeas review of state convictions
frustrates both the States’ sovereign power to punish
offenders and their good-faith attempts to honor constitu-
tional rights.’ It ‘disturbs the State’s significant interest
in repose for concluded litigation, denies society the right
to punish some admitted offenders, and intrudes on state
sovereignty to a degree matched by few exercises of federal
judicial authority.’ ” Id., at 103 (citations omitted).
   Petitioner and the Court today labor to distinguish
these authorities, but I don’t see how they might succeed.
They point to the fact that in Richter no state court had
issued a reasoned order, while here a lower state court
did. See Brief for Petitioner 28–30; ante, at 8. But on
what account of AEDPA or Richter does that factual dis-
tinction make a legal difference? Both the statute and our
4                         WILSON v. SELLERS

                         GORSUCH, J., dissenting

precedent explain that federal habeas review looks to the
final state court decision, not any decision preceding it.
Both instruct that to dislodge the final state court decision
a petitioner must prove it involved an unreasonable appli-
cation of federal law. And to carry that burden in the face
of a final state court summary decision, Richter teaches
that the petitioner must show no lawful basis could have
reasonably supported it. To observe that some final state
court summary decisions are preceded by lower court
reasoned opinions bears no more relevance to the AEDPA
analysis than to say that some final state court summary
decisions are issued on Mondays. 1
   Unable to distinguish Richter, petitioner seeks to con-
fine it by caricature. Because that case requires a federal
court to “imagine” its own arguments for denying habeas
relief and engage in “decision-making-by-hypothetical,” he
argues it should be limited to its facts. Brief for Petitioner
28–30, 33; Reply Brief 9. But the Court today does not
adopt petitioner’s characterization, and for good reason:
Richter requires no such thing. In our adversarial system

——————
  1 Petitioner and the Court separately suggest that Premo v. Moore,

</pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""182991""><a href=""/opinion/182991/premo-v-moore/""><span class=""volume"">562</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">115</span></a></span><pre class=""inline""> (2011), supports their position because the Court there
did not follow Richter’s approach. See Brief for Petitioner 40; ante, at
8–9. But the following sentences from Moore (with emphasis added)
are clear proof it did: “ ‘[t]he question is whether there is any reasonable
argument that counsel satisfied Strickland’s deferential standard,’ ” 562
U. S., at 123 (quoting Richter); “[t]o overcome the limitation imposed by
§2254(d), the Court of Appeals had to conclude that both findings [i.e.,
no deficient performance and no prejudice] would have involved an
unreasonable application of clearly established law,” ibid. (citing
Richter); “[t]he state court here reasonably could have determined that
[no prejudice existed],” id., at 129. Moore simply found that a reason-
able basis—provided by a state postconviction court—could (and did)
support the denial of habeas relief. Id., at 123. It did not rely on an
unreasonable basis provided by a lower court to grant habeas relief, as
petitioner seeks to have us do. Moore thus accords with AEDPA and
our precedents, while petitioner’s presumption does not.

a federal court generally isn’t required to imagine or hy-
pothesize arguments that neither the parties before it nor
any lower court has presented. To determine if a reason-
able basis “could have supported” a summary denial of
habeas relief under Richter, a federal court must look to
the state lower court opinion (if there is one), any argu-
ment presented by the parties in the state proceedings,
and any argument presented in the federal habeas pro-
ceeding. Of course, a federal court sometimes may con-
sider on its own motion alternative bases for denying habeas
relief apparent in the law and the record, but it does not
generally bear an obligation to do so. See Wood v. Mil-
yard, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">566</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">463</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 471–473 (2012) (discussing Day v.

   Nor is that the end of the problems with petitioner’s
“look through” presumption. It also defies traditional
rules of appellate practice that informed Congress’s work
when it adopted AEDPA and that should inform our work
today. McQuiggin v. Perkins, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">569</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">383</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 398, n. 3
(2013). Appellate courts usually have an independent
duty to review the facts and law in the cases that come to
them. Often they see errors in lower court opinions. But
often, too, they may affirm on alternative bases either
argued by the parties or (sometimes) apparent to them on
the face of the record. See, e.g., SEC v. Chenery Corp., </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""103770""><a href=""/opinion/103770/sec-v-chenery-corp/""><span class=""volume"">318</span>

ing the decision of a lower court, it must be affirmed if the
result is correct ‘although the lower court relied upon a
wrong ground or gave a wrong reason’ ”); Wood, supra, at
473. And a busy appellate court sometimes may not see
the profit in devoting its limited resources to explaining
the error and the alternative basis for affirming when the
outcome is sure to remain the same, so it issues a sum-
mary affirmance instead. To reflect these realities, this
Court has traditionally warned readers against presuming

And respect for this
traditional principle of appellate practice surely weighs
against presuming a state court’s summary disposition
rests solely on a lower court’s opinion. On what account
could we reasonably demand more respect for our sum-
mary decisions than we are willing to extend to those of
our state court colleagues?
    Petitioner and the Court offer only this tepid reply.
They suggest that their “look through” presumption seeks
to reflect “realistic[ally]” the basis on which the state
summary decision rests. See Brief for Petitioner 44; ante,
at 7. But to the extent this is a claim that their presump-
tion comports realistically with longstanding traditions of
appellate practice, it is wrong for the reasons just laid out.
In fact, applying traditional understandings of appellate
practice, this Court has refused to presume that state
appellate courts even read lower court opinions rather
than just the briefs before them. See Baldwin v. Reese,
</pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""134723""><a href=""/opinion/134723/baldwin-v-reese/""><span class=""volume"">541</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">27</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 31 (2004). And surely it is a mystery how the
Court might today presume state supreme courts rely on
that which it traditionally presumes they do not read.
    If the argument here is instead an empirical claim that
the “look through” presumption comports realistically with
what happened in this case and others like it, it is wrong
too. Petitioner was convicted in Georgia. And during the

pendency of this case in our Court, the Georgia Supreme
Court issued an order confirming that lower courts in that
State may not “presum[e] that when this Court summarily
denies an application to appeal an order denying habeas
corpus relief, we necessarily agree with everything said in
that order.” Redmon v. Johnson, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">809</span> <span class=""reporter"">S.E.2d</span> <span class=""page"">468</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 472
(Ga. 2018). The court explained that it has long followed
just this rule for all the reasons you’d expect. It inde-
pendently reviews the facts and law in each habeas case.
If it finds something it thinks might amount to a conse-
quential error, the court sets the case for argument and
usually prepares a full opinion. But “[o]n many occa-
sions,” the court finds only “inconsequential errors.” Id.,

  2 Inlanguage that will sound familiar to all judges and lawyers in-
volved in litigating habeas claims, the Georgia Supreme Court ex-
plained that “[t]here are many examples of inconsequential errors, but
among the most common are the following:
  • The habeas court rejects a claim both on a procedural ground and,
    alternatively, on the substantive merits. This Court determines
    that one of those rulings appears factually or legally erroneous, but
    the other is correct, so an appeal would result in the habeas court’s
    judgment being affirmed on the correct ground.
  • In addressing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim under
    Strickland v. Washington, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""111170""><a href=""/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/""><span class=""volume"">466</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">668</span></a></span><pre class=""inline""> (1984), the habeas court
    rules that counsel did not perform deficiently as alleged. That rul-
    ing appears to be erroneous, but this Court determines based on
    our review of the record that no prejudice resulted from the defi-
    cient performance, so an appeal would result in affirming the ha-
    beas court’s judgment. See id., at 697; Rozier v. Caldwell, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">300</span> <span class=""reporter"">Ga.</span>
    <span class=""page"">30</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 31–32 (2016).
  • In addressing other claims that require the petitioner to prove each
    element of a multi-part test, such as a claim under Brady v. Mary-
    land, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""106598""><a href=""/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/""><span class=""volume"">373</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">83</span></a></span><pre class=""inline""> (1963), the habeas court makes factual or legal
    errors regarding the petitioner’s proof of one element but correctly
    concludes (or the record clearly shows) that the petitioner has not
    proved another required element. An appeal would result in this
    Court’s affirming the habeas court’s judgment.

summary affirmance because the costs associated with full
treatment of the appeal outweigh the benefits of correcting
what is at most harmless error, especially given the court’s
heavy caseload and the need to attend to more consequen-
tial matters. 3 Petitioner’s presumption thus does not seek
to reflect reality; it seeks to deny it.
   The presumption is especially unrealistic in another
way. The Court and petitioner presume that a summary
order by a state supreme court adopts all the specific
reasons expressed by a lower state court. In doing so, they
disregard a far more realistic possibility: that the state
supreme court might have relied only on the same grounds
for the denial of relief as did the lower court without nec-
essarily adopting all its reasoning. Here, the lower state
court denied petitioner’s Strickland claim on the grounds
that counsel’s performance was not deficient and peti-
tioner suffered no prejudice. And it gave several reasons for

    •The habeas court misstates a legal standard in one part of its or-
     der, but recites the standard correctly elsewhere in the order, and
     it is clear that the judgment is correct applying the right standard.
  • In addressing a habeas petition with multitudinous claims, the
     habeas court’s order fails to explicitly rule on a claim, but the rec-

published opinions each year, all en banc, meaning that each Justice
(seven of us until 2017, nine now) must evaluate an opinion a day and
author 35 to 50 majority opinions a year, with the help of only two law
clerks in each chambers. Moreover, the Georgia Constitution requires
this Court to issue its decision within the two terms of court after an
appeal is docketed (which means within about eight months, given our
three terms per year). . . . And our reasoned decisions are precedent
binding on all other Georgia courts, . . . so issuing opinions where the
relevant law is already well-established runs the risk of creating

its conclusions: for example, the evidence petitioner sought
to admit “would have been inadmissible on evidentiary
grounds, cumulative of other testimony, or otherwise
would not have, in reasonable probability, changed the
outcome of the trial.” App. 61. In summarily denying
relief, the state supreme court might have reached the
same conclusions (no deficient performance and no preju-
dice) without resting on the exact same reasons.
   While the “look through” presumption cannot be
squared with AEDPA’s text, traditional rules, or Georgia’s
actual practice, petitioner and the Court contend it is at
least consistent with Ylst v. Nunnemaker, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""112642""><a href=""/opinion/112642/ylst-v-nunnemaker/""><span class=""volume"">501</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">797</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">
(1991). See Brief for Petitioner 38; ante, at 5–8. But it is
not. In habeas review of state court convictions, federal
courts may only review questions of federal law. So if a
state court decision rejecting a petitioner’s federal law
claim rests on a state procedural defect (say the petitioner
filed too late under state rules), federal courts generally
have no authority to reach the federal claim. Ylst simply
teaches that, if a lower state court opinion expressly relied
on an independent and adequate state ground, we should
presume a later state appellate court summary disposition
invoked it too. See 501 U. S., at 801, 803. The decision
thus seeks to protect state court decisions from displace-
ment and reaches a result consistent with the traditional
rule that a summary order invokes all fairly presented
bases for affirmance.
   Neither can Ylst be reimagined today as meaning any-
thing more. The case came years before AEDPA’s new
standards for habeas review and can offer nothing useful
about them. The work of interpreting AEDPA’s demands
was left instead to Richter. And, as we’ve seen, Richter
forecloses petitioner’s presumption. Of course, and as
petitioner stresses, Richter didn’t overrule Ylst. But that’s
for the simple reason that Ylst continues to do important,
if limited, work in the disposition of procedural default
10                  WILSON v. SELLERS

                   GORSUCH, J., dissenting

claims because “AEDPA did not change the application of
pre-AEDPA procedural default principles.” B. Means,
Federal Habeas Manual §9B:3 (2017).
   Uncomfortable questions follow too from any effort to
reimagine Ylst. If we were to take Ylst as suggesting that
summary decisions presumptively rely only on the reasons
found in lower court opinions, wouldn’t we have to over-
rule our many precedents like Wynne and Mandel that
explicitly reject any such presumption? Wouldn’t circuit
courts have to discard their own similar precedents? See
supra, at 5–6. Consistency would seem to demand no less.
   The only answer petitioner and the Court offer is no
answer at all. Consistency, they suggest, is overrated.
Everywhere else in the law we should retain the usual rule
that a summary affirmance can’t be read as presumptively
resting on the lower court’s reasons. They encourage us to
use Ylst only as a tool for making a special exception for
AEDPA cases: here and here alone should we adopt peti-
tioner’s “look through” presumption. Brief for Petitioner
18, 20; ante, at 10 (stating that “we ‘look through’ the
silent decision for a specific and narrow purpose” under
AEDPA). But just stating this good-for-habeas-only rule
should be enough to reject it. Summary orders that hap-
pen to arise in state habeas cases should receive no less
respect than those that arise anywhere else in the law. If
anything, they should receive more respect, because federal
habeas review of state court decisions “ ‘intrudes on
state sovereignty to a degree matched by few exercises of
federal judicial authority.’ ” Richter, 562 U. S., at 103.
                             *
  Petitioner’s novel presumption not only lacks any prov-
enance in the law, it promises nothing for its trouble.
Consider the most obvious question it invites, one sug-
gested by the facts of our own case: what happens when a
state supreme court issues an order explaining that its
                 Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)          11

                    GORSUCH, J., dissenting

summary affirmances do not necessarily adopt the reasons
in lower court opinions? Should that be enough to rebut
the “look through” presumption? After defending the
presumption, even the dissent in the Eleventh Circuit
decision under review recognized that a disclaimer along
these lines should suffice to rebut it. See Wilson v. War-
den, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">834</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.3d</span> <span class=""page"">1227</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 1263 (2016) (en banc) (opinion of J.
Pryor, J.) (“The Georgia Supreme Court could simply issue
a one-line order denying an application for a certificate of
probable cause that indicates agreement with the result
the superior court reached but not the lower court’s rea-
sons for rejecting the petitioner’s claim”). And, of course,
the Georgia Supreme Court has recently responded to the
dissent’s invitation by issuing just such a disclaimer. So
in the end petitioner’s presumption seems likely to accom-
plish nothing for him and only needless work for others—
inducing more state supreme courts to churn out more
orders restating the obvious fact that their summary
dispositions don’t necessarily rest on the reasons given by
lower courts. Along the way, too, it seems federal courts
will have their hands full. For while the Eleventh Circuit
dissent had no difficulty acknowledging that an order like
Georgia’s suffices to overcome petitioner’s presumption,
the Court today refuses to supply the same obvious
answer.
  Consider, too, the questions that would follow in the
unlikely event a general order like the one from the Geor-
gia Supreme Court wasn’t considered enough to overcome
petitioner’s presumption. Quickly federal courts would be
forced to decide: does the “look through” presumption
survive even when a state supreme court includes lan-
guage in every summary order explaining that its decision
does not necessarily adopt the reasoning below? What if
the state supreme court says something slightly different
but to the same effect, declaring in each case that it has
independently considered the relevant law and evidence
12                  WILSON v. SELLERS

                    GORSUCH, J., dissenting

before denying relief? And if we start dictating what state
court disclaimers should look like and where they should
appear, what exactly is left of Congress’s direction that
our review is intended to guard only against “ ‘extreme
malfunctions’ ” in state criminal justice systems? Richter,
supra, at 102. Wouldn’t we be slipping into the business of
“tell[ing] state courts how they must write their opinions,”
something this Court has long said federal habeas courts
“have no power” to do? Coleman v. Thompson, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""112640""><a href=""/opinion/112640/coleman-v-thompson/""><span class=""volume"">501</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span>
<span class=""page"">722</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 739 (1991).
   Apart from whether a (general or case-specific) order
from a state supreme court suffices to overcome petition-
er’s presumption, there’s the question what else might.
Say a lower state court opinion includes an error but the
legal briefs or other submissions presented to the state
supreme court supply sound alternative bases for affir-
mance. In those circumstances, should a federal habeas
court really presume that the state supreme court chose to
repeat the lower court’s mistake rather than rely on the
solid grounds argued to it by the parties? What if a sound
alternative basis for affirmance is presented for the first
time in the parties’ federal habeas submissions: are we to
presume that the state supreme court was somehow less
able to identify a reasonable basis for affirmance than
federal habeas counsel?
   Here at least the Court does offer an answer. Petitioner
insists that federal courts should presume that state
supreme court summary orders rest on unreasonable lower
state court opinions even in the face of reasonable alterna-
tive arguments presented to the state supreme court or in
federal habeas proceedings. But seeming to recognize the
unreasonableness of this request, the Court opts to re-
shape radically petitioner’s proposed presumption before
adopting it. First, the Court states that “it is more likely
that a state supreme court’s single word ‘affirm’ rests upon
alternative grounds where the lower state court decision is
                 Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)          13

                    GORSUCH, J., dissenting

unreasonable.” Ante, at 9. Then, the Court proceeds to
explain that “a federal habeas court may conclude that
counsel has rebutted the presumption on the basis of
convincing alternative arguments for affirmance made to
the State’s highest court or equivalent evidence presented
in its briefing to the federal court similarly establishing
that the State’s highest court relied on a different ground
than the lower state court, such as the existence of a valid
ground for affirmance that is obvious from the state-court
record.” Ibid.
   The Court’s reshaping of petitioner’s presumption re-
veals just how futile this whole business really is. If, as
the Court holds, the “look through” presumption can be
rebutted “where the lower state court decision is unrea-
sonable,” ibid., it’s hard to see what good it does. Peti-
tioner sought to assign unreasonable lower court opinions to
final state court summary decisions. To hear now that
essentially only reasonable (and so sustainable) lower
state court opinions are presumptively adopted by final
state court summary decisions will surely leave him sour
on this journey and federal habeas courts scratching their
heads about the point of it all. And if, as the Court also
tells us, a federal habeas court can always deny relief on a
basis that is apparent from the record or on the basis of
alternative arguments presented by the parties in state or
federal proceedings, then the “look through” presumption
truly means nothing and we are back where we started.
With the Court’s revisions to petitioner’s presumption, a
federal habeas court is neither obliged to look through
exclusively to the reasons given by a lower state court, nor
required to presume that a summary order adopts those
reasons.
   All this is welcome news of a sort. The Court may prom-
ise us a future of foraging through presumptions and
rebuttals. But at least at the end of it we rest knowing
that what was true before remains true today: a federal
14                  WILSON v. SELLERS

                    GORSUCH, J., dissenting

habeas court should look at all the arguments presented in
state and federal court and examine the state court record.
And a federal habeas court should sustain a state court
summary decision denying relief if those materials reveal
a basis to do so reasonably consistent with this Court’s
holdings. Exactly what a federal court applying the stat-
ute and Richter has had to do all along. See supra, at 2–5.
And exactly what the Eleventh Circuit correctly held it
had to do in this case.
                              *
   Today, petitioner invites us to adopt a novel presump-
tion that AEDPA, traditional principles of appellate re-
view, and Georgia practice all preclude. It’s an invitation
that requires us to treat the work of state court colleagues
with disrespect we would not tolerate for our own. And all
to what end? None at all, it turns out. As modified by the
Court, petitioner’s presumption nearly drops us back
where we began, with only trouble to show for the effort.
Respectfully, I would decline the invitation to this circui-
tous journey and just affirm.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT

    No. 16–6855.      Argued October 30, 2017—Decided April 17, 2018
Petitioner Marion Wilson was convicted of murder and sentenced to
  death. He sought habeas relief in Georgia Superior Court, claiming
  that his counsel’s ineffectiveness during sentencing violated the Sixth
  Amendment. The court denied the petition, in relevant part, because
  it concluded that counsel’s performance was not deficient and had not
  prejudiced Wilson. The Georgia Supreme Court summarily denied
  his application for a certificate of probable cause to appeal. Wilson
  subsequently filed a federal habeas petition, raising the same ineffec-
  tive-assistance claim. The District Court assumed that his counsel
  was deficient but deferred to the state habeas court’s conclusion that
  any deficiencies did not prejudice Wilson. The Eleventh Circuit af-
  firmed. First, however, the panel concluded that the District Court
  was wrong to “look though” the State Supreme Court’s unexplained
  decision and assume that it rested on the grounds given in the state
  habeas court’s opinion, rather than ask what arguments “could have
  supported” the State Supreme Court’s summary decision. The en
  banc court agreed with the panel’s methodology.
Held: A federal habeas court reviewing an unexplained state-court de-
 cision on the merits should “look through” that decision to the last re-
 lated state-court decision that provides a relevant rationale and pre-
 sume that the unexplained decision adopted the same reasoning.
 The State may rebut the presumption by showing that the unex-
 plained decision most likely relied on different grounds than the rea-
 soned decision below. Pp. 5–11.
    (a) In Ylst v. Nunnemaker, 501 U. S. 797, the Court held that
 where there has been one reasoned state judgment rejecting a federal
 claim, later unexplained orders upholding that judgment or rejecting
 the same claim are presumed to rest upon the same ground. In Ylst,
2                          WILSON v. SELLERS

                                  Syllabus

    where the last reasoned opinion on the claim explicitly imposed a
    procedural default, the Court presumed that a later decision rejecting
    the claim did not silently disregard that bar and consider the merits.
       Since Ylst, every Circuit to have considered the matter, but for the
    Eleventh Circuit, has applied a “look through” presumption even
    where the state courts did not apply a procedural bar to review, and
    most Circuits applied the presumption prior to Ylst. The presump-
    tion is often realistic, for state higher courts often issue summary de-
    cisions when they have examined the lower court’s reasoning and
    found nothing significant with which they disagree. The presump-
    tion also is often more efficiently applied than a contrary approach
    that would require a federal court to imagine what might have been
    the state court’s supportive reasoning.
       The State argues that Harrington v. Richter, 562 U. S. 86, controls
    here and that Ylst should apply, at most, where the federal habeas
    court is trying to determine whether a state-court decision without
    opinion rested on a state procedural ground or whether the state
    court reached the merits of a federal issue. Richter, however, did not
    directly concern the issue in this case—whether to “look through” the
    silent state higher court opinion to the lower court’s reasoned opinion
    in order to determine the reasons for the higher court’s decision. In
    Richter, there was no lower court opinion to look to. And Richter does
    not say that Ylst’s reasoning does not apply in the context of an un-
    explained decision on the merits. Indeed, this Court has “looked
    though” to lower court decisions in cases involving the merits. See,
    e.g., Premo v. Moore, 562 U. S. 115, 123–133. Pp. 5–9.
       (b) The State’s further arguments are unconvincing. It points out
    that the “look though” presumption may not accurately identify the
    grounds for a higher court’s decision. But the “look through” pre-
    sumption is not an absolute rule. Additional evidence that might not
    be sufficient to rebut the presumption in a case like Ylst, where the
    lower court rested on a state-law procedural ground, would allow a
    federal court to conclude that counsel has rebutted the presumption
    in a case decided on the merits. For instance, a federal court may
    conclude that the presumption is rebutted where counsel identifies
    convincing alternative arguments for affirmance that were made to
    the State’s highest court, or equivalent evidence such as an alterna-
    tive ground that is obvious in the state-court record. The State also
    argues that this Court does not necessarily presume that a federal
    court of appeals’ silent opinion adopts the reasoning of the court be-
    low, but that is a different context. Were there to be a “look through”
    approach as a general matter in that context, judges and lawyers
    might read those decisions as creating, through silence, binding cir-
    cuit precedent. Here, a federal court “looks through” the silent deci-

  sion for a specific and narrow purpose, to identify the grounds for the
  higher court’s decision as the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Pen-
  alty Act requires. Nor does the “look through” approach show disre-
  spect for the States; rather, it seeks to replicate the grounds for the
  higher state court’s decision. Finally, the “look though” approach is
  unlikely to lead state courts to write full opinions where they would
  have preferred to decide summarily, at least not to any significant
  degree. Pp. 9–11.

  MARION WILSON, PETITIONER v. ERIC SELLERS,
                  WARDEN
 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT
                                 [April 17, 2018]

   JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.
   The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of
1996 (AEDPA) requires a prisoner who challenges (in a
federal habeas court) a matter “adjudicated on the merits
in State court” to show that the relevant state-court “deci-
sion” (1) “was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable
application of, clearly established Federal law,” or (2) “was
based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in
light of the evidence presented in the State court proceed-
ing.” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d). Deciding whether a state
court’s decision “involved” an unreasonable application of
federal law or “was based on” an unreasonable determina-
tion of fact requires the federal habeas court to “train its
attention on the particular reasons—both legal and fac-
tual—why state courts rejected a state prisoner’s federal
claims,” Hittson v. Chatman, 576 U. S. ___, ___ (2015)
(GINSBURG, J., concurring in denial of certiorari) (slip op.,
at 1), and to give appropriate deference to that decision,
Harrington v. Richter, 562 U. S. 86, 101–102 (2011).
   This is a straightforward inquiry when the last state
court to decide a prisoner’s federal claim explains its
2                   WILSON v. SELLERS

                     Opinion of the Court

decision on the merits in a reasoned opinion. In that case,
a federal habeas court simply reviews the specific reasons
given by the state court and defers to those reasons if they
are reasonable. We have affirmed this approach time and
again. See, e.g., Porter v. McCollum, 558 U. S. 30, 39–44
(2009) (per curiam); Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U. S. 374,
388–392 (2005); Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 523–538
(2003).
   The issue before us, however, is more difficult. It con-
cerns how a federal habeas court is to find the state court’s
reasons when the relevant state-court decision on the
merits, say, a state supreme court decision, does not come
accompanied with those reasons. For instance, the deci-
sion may consist of a one-word order, such as “affirmed” or
“denied.” What then is the federal habeas court to do?
We hold that the federal court should “look through” the
unexplained decision to the last related state-court deci-
sion that does provide a relevant rationale. It should then
presume that the unexplained decision adopted the same
reasoning. But the State may rebut the presumption by
showing that the unexplained affirmance relied or most
likely did rely on different grounds than the lower state
court’s decision, such as alternative grounds for affir-
mance that were briefed or argued to the state supreme
court or obvious in the record it reviewed.
                             I
  In 1997 a Georgia jury convicted petitioner, Marion
Wilson, of murder and related crimes. After a sentencing
hearing, the jury sentenced Wilson to death. In 1999 the
Georgia Supreme Court affirmed Wilson’s conviction and
sentence, Wilson v. State, 271 Ga. 811, 525 S. E. 2d 339
(1999), and this Court denied his petition for certiorari,
Wilson v. Georgia, 531 U. S. 838 (2000).
  Wilson then filed a petition for habeas corpus in a state
court, the Superior Court for Butts County. Among other
                 Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)           3

                     Opinion of the Court

things, he claimed that his counsel was “ineffective” dur-
ing his sentencing, in violation of the Sixth Amendment.
See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 687 (1984)
(setting forth “two components” of an ineffective-
assistance-of-counsel claim: “that counsel’s performance
was deficient” and “that the deficient performance preju-
diced the defense”). Wilson identified new evidence that
he argued trial counsel should have introduced at sentenc-
ing, namely, testimony from various witnesses about
Wilson’s childhood and the impairment of the frontal lobe
of Wilson’s brain.
   After a hearing, the state habeas court denied the peti-
tion in relevant part because it thought Wilson’s evidence
did not show that counsel was “deficient,” and, in any
event, counsel’s failure to find and present the new evi-
dence that Wilson offered had not prejudiced Wilson.
Wilson v. Terry, No. 2001–v–38 (Super. Ct. Butts Cty.,
Ga., Dec. 1, 2008), App. 60–61. In the court’s view, that
was because the new evidence was “inadmissible on evi-
dentiary grounds,” was “cumulative of other testimony,” or
“otherwise would not have, in reasonable probability,
changed the outcome of the trial.” Id., at 61. Wilson
applied to the Georgia Supreme Court for a certificate of
probable cause to appeal the state habeas court’s decision.
But the Georgia Supreme Court denied the application
without any explanatory opinion. Wilson v. Terry, No.
2001–v–38 (May 3, 2010), App. 87, cert. denied, 562 U. S.
1093 (2010).
   Wilson subsequently filed a petition for habeas corpus in
the United States District Court for the Middle District of
Georgia. He made what was essentially the same “ineffec-
tive assistance” claim. After a hearing, the District Court
denied Wilson’s petition. Wilson v. Humphrey, No. 5:10–
cv–489 (Dec. 19, 2013), App. 88–89. The court assumed
that Wilson’s counsel had indeed been “deficient” in failing
adequately to investigate Wilson’s background and physi-
4                   WILSON v. SELLERS

                     Opinion of the Court

cal condition for mitigation evidence and to present what
he likely would have found at the sentencing hearing. Id.,
at 144. But, the court nonetheless deferred to the state
habeas court’s conclusion that these deficiencies did not
“prejudice” Wilson, primarily because the testimony of
many witnesses was “cumulative,” and because the evi-
dence of physical impairments did not include any physi-
cal examination or other support that would have shown
the state-court determination was “unreasonable.” Id., at
187; see Richter, 562 U. S., at 111–112.
   Wilson appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Elev-
enth Circuit. Wilson v. Warden, 774 F. 3d 671 (2014). The
panel first held that the District Court had used the wrong
method for determining the reasoning of the relevant state
court, namely, that of the Georgia Supreme Court (the
final and highest state court to decide the merits of Wil-
son’s claims). Id., at 678. That state-court decision, the
panel conceded, was made without an opinion. But, the
federal court was wrong to “look through” that decision
and assume that it rested on the grounds given in the
lower court’s decision. Instead of “looking through” the
decision to the state habeas court’s opinion, the federal
court should have asked what arguments “could have
supported” the Georgia Supreme Court’s refusal to grant
permission to appeal. The panel proceeded to identify a
number of bases that it believed reasonably could have
supported the decision. Id., at 678–681.
   The Eleventh Circuit then granted Wilson rehearing en
banc so that it could consider the matter of methodology.
Wilson v. Warden, 834 F. 3d 1227 (2016). Ultimately six
judges (a majority) agreed with the panel and held that its
“could have supported” approach was correct. Id., at 1235.
Five dissenting judges believed that the District Court
should have used the methodology it did use, namely, the
“look through” approach. Id., at 1242–1247, 1247–1269.
Wilson then sought certiorari here. Because the Eleventh

                     Opinion of the Court

Circuit’s opinion creates a split among the Circuits, we
granted the petition. Compare id., at 1285 (applying
“could have supported” approach), with Grueninger v.
Director, Va. Dept. of Corrections, 813 F. 3d 517, 525–526
(CA4 2016) (applying “look through” presumption post-
Richter), and Cannedy v. Adams, 706 F. 3d 1148, 1156–
1159 (CA9 2013) (same); see also Clements v. Clarke, 592
F. 3d 45, 52 (CA1 2010) (applying “look through” presump-
tion pre-Richter); Bond v. Beard, 539 F. 3d 256, 289–290
(CA3 2008) (same); Mark v. Ault, 498 F. 3d 775, 782–783
(CA8 2007) (same); Joseph v. Coyle, 469 F. 3d 441, 450
(CA6 2006) (same).
                               II
   We conclude that federal habeas law employs a “look
through” presumption. That conclusion has parallels in
this Court’s precedent. In Ylst v. Nunnemaker, a defend-
ant, convicted in a California state court of murder, ap-
pealed his conviction to the state appeals court where he
raised a constitutional claim based on Miranda v. Arizona,
384 U. S. 436 (1966). 501 U. S. 797, 799–800 (1991). The
appeals court rejected that claim, writing that “ ‘an objec-
tion based upon a Miranda violation cannot be raised for
the first time on appeal.’ ” Id., at 799. The defendant then
similarly challenged his conviction in the California Su-
preme Court and on collateral review in several state
courts (including once again the California Supreme
Court). In each of these latter instances the state court
denied the defendant relief (or review). In each instance
the court did so without an opinion or other explanation.
Id., at 799–800.
   Subsequently, the defendant asked a federal habeas
court to review his constitutional claim. Id., at 800. The
higher state courts had given no reason for their decision.
And this Court ultimately had to decide how the federal
court was to find the state court’s reasoning in those cir-
6                   WILSON v. SELLERS

                    Opinion of the Court

cumstances. Should it have “looked through” the unrea-
soned decisions to the state procedural ground articulated
in the appeals court or should it have used a different
method?
   In answering that question Justice Scalia wrote the
following for the Court:
    “The problem we face arises, of course, because many
    formulary orders are not meant to convey anything as
    to the reason for the decision. Attributing a reason is
    therefore both difficult and artificial. We think that
    the attribution necessary for federal habeas purposes
    can be facilitated, and sound results more often as-
    sured, by applying the following presumption: Where
    there has been one reasoned state judgment rejecting
    a federal claim, later unexplained orders upholding
    that judgment or rejecting the same claim rest upon
    the same ground. If an earlier opinion ‘fairly ap-
    pear[s] to rest primarily upon federal law,’ we will
    presume that no procedural default has been invoked
    by a subsequent unexplained order that leaves the
    judgment or its consequences in place. Similarly
    where, as here, the last reasoned opinion on the claim
    explicitly imposes a procedural default, we will pre-
    sume that a later decision rejecting the claim did not
    silently disregard that bar and consider the merits.”
    Id., at 803 (citation omitted).
  Since Ylst, every Circuit to have considered the matter
has applied this presumption, often called the “look
through” presumption, but for the Eleventh Circuit—even
where the state courts did not apply a procedural bar to
review. See supra, at 4–5. And most Federal Circuits
applied it prior to Ylst. See Ylst, supra, at 803 (citing
Prihoda v. McCaughtry, 910 F. 2d 1379, 1383 (CA7 1990);
Harmon v. Barton, 894 F. 2d 1268, 1272 (CA11 1990);
Evans v. Thompson, 881 F. 2d 117, 123, n. 2 (CA4 1989);

                     Opinion of the Court

Ellis v. Lynaugh, 873 F. 2d 830, 838 (CA5 1989)).
  That is not surprising in light of the fact that the “look
through” presumption is often realistic, for state higher
courts often (but certainly not always, see Redmon v.
Johnson, 2018 WL 415714 (Ga., Jan. 16, 2018)) write
“denied” or “affirmed” or “dismissed” when they have
examined the lower court’s reasoning and found nothing
significant with which they disagree.
  Moreover, a “look through” presumption is often (but not
always) more efficiently applied than a contrary ap-
proach—an approach, for example, that would require a
federal habeas court to imagine what might have been the
state court’s supportive reasoning. The latter task may
prove particularly difficult where the issue involves state
law, such as state procedural rules that may constrain the
scope of a reviewing court’s summary decision, a matter in
which a federal judge often lacks comparative expertise.
See Ylst, supra, at 805.
  The State points to a later case, Harrington v. Richter,
562 U. S. 86 (2011), which, it says, controls here instead of
Ylst. In its view, Ylst should apply, at most, to cases in
which the federal habeas court is trying to determine
whether a state-court decision without opinion rested on a
state procedural ground (for example, a procedural de-
fault) or whether the state court has reached the merits of
a federal issue. In support, it notes that Richter held that
the state-court decisions to which AEDPA refers include
summary dispositions, i.e., decisions without opinion.
Richter added that “determining whether a state court’s
decision resulted from an unreasonable legal or factual
conclusion does not require that there be an opinion from
the state court explaining the state court’s reasoning.”
562 U. S., at 98.
  Richter then said that, where “a state court’s decision is
unaccompanied by an explanation, the habeas petitioner’s
burden still must be met by showing there was no reason-
8                   WILSON v. SELLERS

                     Opinion of the Court

able basis for the state court to deny relief.” Ibid. And the
Court concluded that, when “a federal claim has been
presented to a state court and the state court has denied
relief, it may be presumed that the state court adjudicated
the claim on the merits in the absence of any indication or
state-law procedural principles to the contrary.” Id., at 99.
   In our view, however, Richter does not control here. For
one thing, Richter did not directly concern the issue before
us—whether to “look through” the silent state higher court
opinion to the reasoned opinion of a lower court in order to
determine the reasons for the higher court’s decision.
Indeed, it could not have considered that matter, for in
Richter, there was no lower court opinion to look to. That
is because the convicted defendant sought to raise his
federal constitutional claim for the first time in the Cali-
fornia Supreme Court (via a direct petition for habeas
corpus, as California law permits). Id., at 96.
   For another thing, Richter does not say the reasoning of
Ylst does not apply in the context of an unexplained deci-
sion on the merits. To the contrary, the Court noted that
it was setting forth a presumption, which “may be over-
come when there is reason to think some other explana-
tion for the state court’s decision is more likely.” Richter,
supra, at 99–100. And it referred in support to Ylst, 501
U. S., at 803.
   Further, we have “looked through” to lower court deci-
sions in cases involving the merits. See, e.g., Premo v.
Moore, 562 U. S. 115, 123–133 (2011); Sears v. Upton,
561 U. S. 945, 951–956 (2010) (per curiam). Indeed, we de-
cided one of those cases, Premo, on the same day we decided
Richter. And in our opinion in Richter we referred to
Premo. 562 U. S., at 91. Had we intended Richter’s “could
have supported” framework to apply even where there is a
reasoned decision by a lower state court, our opinion in
Premo would have looked very different. We did not even
cite the reviewing state court’s summary affirmance.
                 Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)            9

                     Opinion of the Court

Instead, we focused exclusively on the actual reasons
given by the lower state court, and we deferred to those
reasons under AEDPA. 562 U. S., at 132 (“The state
postconviction court’s decision involved no unreasonable
application of Supreme Court precedent”).
                             III
   The State’s further arguments do not convince us. The
State points out that there could be many cases in which a
“look through” presumption does not accurately identify
the grounds for the higher court’s decision. And we agree.
We also agree that it is more likely that a state supreme
court’s single word “affirm” rests upon alternative grounds
where the lower state court decision is unreasonable than,
e.g., where the lower court rested on a state-law proce-
dural ground, as in Ylst. But that is why we have set forth a
presumption and not an absolute rule. And the unreason-
ableness of the lower court’s decision itself provides some
evidence that makes it less likely the state supreme court
adopted the same reasoning. Thus, additional evidence
that might not be sufficient to rebut the presumption in a
case like Ylst would allow a federal court to conclude that
counsel has rebutted the presumption in a case like this
one. For instance, a federal habeas court may conclude
that counsel has rebutted the presumption on the basis of
convincing alternative arguments for affirmance made to
the State’s highest court or equivalent evidence presented
in its briefing to the federal court similarly establishing
that the State’s highest court relied on a different ground
than the lower state court, such as the existence of a valid
ground for affirmance that is obvious from the state-court
record. The dissent argues that the Georgia Supreme
Court’s recent decision in Redmon v. Johnson rebuts the
presumption in Georgia because that court indicated its
summary decisions should not be read to adopt the lower
court’s reasoning.      Post, at 6–8, 10–11 (opinion of
10                  WILSON v. SELLERS

                     Opinion of the Court

GORSUCH, J.). This misses the point. A presumption that
can be rebutted by evidence of, for instance, an alternative
ground that was argued or that is clear in the record was
the likely basis for the decision is in accord with full and
proper respect for state courts, like those in Georgia,
which have well-established systems and procedures in
place in order to ensure proper consideration to the argu-
ments and contention in the many cases they must process
to determine whether relief should be granted when a
criminal conviction or its ensuing sentence is challenged.
   The State also points out that we do not necessarily
presume that a silent opinion of a federal court of appeals
adopts the reasoning of the court below. The dissent
similarly invokes these “traditional rules of appellate
practice.” See post, at 5–6, 10. But neither the State nor
the dissent provides examples of similar context. Were we
to adopt a “look through” approach in respect to silent
federal appeals court decisions as a general matter in
other contexts, we would risk judges and lawyers reading
those decisions as creating, through silence, a precedent
that could be read as binding throughout the circuit—just
what a silent decision may be thought not to do. Here,
however, we “look through” the silent decision for a spe-
cific and narrow purpose—to identify the grounds for the
higher court’s decision, as AEDPA directs us to do. See
supra, at 1–2. We see no reason why the federal court’s
interpretation of the state court’s silence should be taken
as binding precedent outside this context, for example, as
a statewide binding interpretation of state law.
   Further, the State argues that the “look through” ap-
proach shows disrespect for the States. See Brief for
Respondent 39 (“Wilson’s approach to summary decisions
reflects an utter lack of faith in the ability of the highest
state courts to adjudicate constitutional rights”). We do
not believe this is so. Rather the presumption seeks to
replicate the grounds for the higher state court’s decision.
                  Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)           11

                      Opinion of the Court

Where there are convincing grounds to believe the silent
court had a different basis for its decision than the analy-
sis followed by the previous court, the federal habeas court
is free, as we have said, to find to the contrary. In our
view, this approach is more likely to respect what the
state court actually did, and easier to apply in practice,
than to ask the federal court to substitute for silence the
federal court’s thought as to more supportive reasoning.
  Finally, the State argues that the “look through” ap-
proach will lead state courts to believe they must write full
opinions where, given the workload, they would have
preferred to have decided summarily. Though the matter
is empirical, given the narrowness of the context, we do
not believe that they will feel compelled to do so—at least
not to any significant degree. The State offers no such
evidence in the many Circuits that have applied Ylst
outside the procedural context. See supra, at 5.
  For these reasons, we reverse the Eleventh Circuit’s
judgment and remand the case for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.
                                             It is so ordered.

  MARION WILSON, PETITIONER v. ERIC SELLERS,
                  WARDEN
 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT
                        [April 17, 2018]

   JUSTICE GORSUCH, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS and
JUSTICE ALITO join, dissenting.
   After a state supreme court issues a summary order
sustaining a criminal conviction, should a federal habeas
court reviewing that decision presume it rests only on the
reasons found in a lower state court opinion? The answer
is no. The statute governing federal habeas review per-
mits no such “look through” presumption. Nor do tradi-
tional principles of appellate review. In fact, we demand
the opposite presumption for our work—telling readers
that we independently review each case and that our
summary affirmances may be read only as signaling
agreement with a lower court’s judgment and not neces-
sarily its reasons. Because I can discern no good reason to
treat the work of our state court colleagues with less
respect than we demand for our own, I would reject peti-
tioner’s presumption and must respectfully dissent.
   Even so, some good news can be found here. While the
Court agrees to adopt a “look through” presumption, it
does so only after making major modifications to petition-
er’s proposal. The Court tells us that the presumption
should count for little in cases “where the lower state court
decision is unreasonable” because it is not “likely” a state
supreme court would adopt unreasonable reasoning.
Ante, at 9. In cases like that too, the Court explains,
2                   WILSON v. SELLERS

                    GORSUCH, J., dissenting

federal courts remain free to sustain state court convic-
tions whenever reasonable “ground[s] for affirmance [are]
obvious from the state-court record” or appear in the
parties’ submissions in state court or the federal habeas
proceeding. Ibid. Exactly right, and exactly what the law
has always demanded. So while the Court takes us on a
journey through novel presumptions and rebuttals, it
happily returns us in the end very nearly to the place
where we began and belonged all along.
                              *
   To see the problem with petitioner’s presumption, start
with the statute. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death
Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) governs federal review of
state criminal convictions. It says a federal court may not
grant habeas relief overturning a state court conviction
“with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the
merits in State court proceedings” unless (among other
things) the petitioner can show that the state court pro-
ceedings “resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or
involved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab-
lished Federal law.” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). As the text
and our precedent make clear, a federal habeas court must
focus its review on the final state court decision on the
merits, not any preceding decision by an inferior state
court. See Greene v. Fisher, 565 U. S. 34, 40 (2011). Nor
does it matter whether the final state court decision comes
with a full opinion or in a summary order: the same defer-
ence is due all final state court decisions. Harrington v.
Richter, 562 U. S. 86, 98 (2011); Cullen v. Pinholster, 563
U. S. 170, 187 (2011).
   The upshot of these directions is clear. Even when the
final state court decision “is unaccompanied by an expla-
nation, the habeas petitioner’s burden still must be met by
showing there was no reasonable basis for the state court
to deny relief.” Richter, 562 U. S., at 98 (emphasis added).

                    GORSUCH, J., dissenting

And before a federal court can disregard a final summary
state court decision, it “must determine what arguments
or theories . . . could have supporte[d] the state court’s
decision; and then it must ask whether it is possible fair-
minded jurists could disagree that those arguments or
theories are inconsistent with the holding in a prior deci-
sion of this Court.” Id., at 102 (emphasis added). Far
from suggesting federal courts should presume a state
supreme court summary order rests on views expressed in
a lower court’s opinion, then, AEDPA and our precedents
require more nearly the opposite presumption: federal
courts must presume the order rests on any reasonable
basis the law and facts allow.
   If this standard seems hard for a habeas petitioner to
overcome, “that is because it was meant to be.” Ibid. In
AEDPA, Congress rejected the notion that federal habeas
review should be “a substitute for ordinary error correc-
tion.” Id., at 102–103. Instead, AEDPA “reflects the view
that habeas corpus is a ‘guard against extreme malfunc-
tions in the state criminal justice systems.’ ” Id., at 102
(emphasis added). “The reasons for this approach are
familiar. ‘Federal habeas review of state convictions
frustrates both the States’ sovereign power to punish
offenders and their good-faith attempts to honor constitu-
tional rights.’ It ‘disturbs the State’s significant interest
in repose for concluded litigation, denies society the right
to punish some admitted offenders, and intrudes on state
sovereignty to a degree matched by few exercises of federal
judicial authority.’ ” Id., at 103 (citations omitted).
   Petitioner and the Court today labor to distinguish
these authorities, but I don’t see how they might succeed.
They point to the fact that in Richter no state court had
issued a reasoned order, while here a lower state court
did. See Brief for Petitioner 28–30; ante, at 8. But on
what account of AEDPA or Richter does that factual dis-
tinction make a legal difference? Both the statute and our
4                         WILSON v. SELLERS

                         GORSUCH, J., dissenting

precedent explain that federal habeas review looks to the
final state court decision, not any decision preceding it.
Both instruct that to dislodge the final state court decision
a petitioner must prove it involved an unreasonable appli-
cation of federal law. And to carry that burden in the face
of a final state court summary decision, Richter teaches
that the petitioner must show no lawful basis could have
reasonably supported it. To observe that some final state
court summary decisions are preceded by lower court
reasoned opinions bears no more relevance to the AEDPA
analysis than to say that some final state court summary
decisions are issued on Mondays. 1
   Unable to distinguish Richter, petitioner seeks to con-
fine it by caricature. Because that case requires a federal
court to “imagine” its own arguments for denying habeas
relief and engage in “decision-making-by-hypothetical,” he
argues it should be limited to its facts. Brief for Petitioner
28–30, 33; Reply Brief 9. But the Court today does not
adopt petitioner’s characterization, and for good reason:
Richter requires no such thing. In our adversarial system

——————
  1 Petitioner and the Court separately suggest that Premo v. Moore,

562 U. S. 115 (2011), supports their position because the Court there
did not follow Richter’s approach. See Brief for Petitioner 40; ante, at
8–9. But the following sentences from Moore (with emphasis added)
are clear proof it did: “ ‘[t]he question is whether there is any reasonable
argument that counsel satisfied Strickland’s deferential standard,’ ” 562
U. S., at 123 (quoting Richter); “[t]o overcome the limitation imposed by
§2254(d), the Court of Appeals had to conclude that both findings [i.e.,
no deficient performance and no prejudice] would have involved an
unreasonable application of clearly established law,” ibid. (citing
Richter); “[t]he state court here reasonably could have determined that
[no prejudice existed],” id., at 129. Moore simply found that a reason-
able basis—provided by a state postconviction court—could (and did)
support the denial of habeas relief. Id., at 123. It did not rely on an
unreasonable basis provided by a lower court to grant habeas relief, as
petitioner seeks to have us do. Moore thus accords with AEDPA and
our precedents, while petitioner’s presumption does not.

a federal court generally isn’t required to imagine or hy-
pothesize arguments that neither the parties before it nor
any lower court has presented. To determine if a reason-
able basis “could have supported” a summary denial of
habeas relief under Richter, a federal court must look to
the state lower court opinion (if there is one), any argu-
ment presented by the parties in the state proceedings,
and any argument presented in the federal habeas pro-
ceeding. Of course, a federal court sometimes may con-
sider on its own motion alternative bases for denying habeas
relief apparent in the law and the record, but it does not
generally bear an obligation to do so. See Wood v. Mil-
yard, 566 U. S. 463, 471–473 (2012) (discussing Day v.
McDonough, 547 U. S. 198 (2006), and Granberry v. Greer,
481 U. S. 129 (1987)).
   Nor is that the end of the problems with petitioner’s
“look through” presumption. It also defies traditional
rules of appellate practice that informed Congress’s work
when it adopted AEDPA and that should inform our work
today. McQuiggin v. Perkins, 569 U. S. 383, 398, n. 3
(2013). Appellate courts usually have an independent
duty to review the facts and law in the cases that come to
them. Often they see errors in lower court opinions. But
often, too, they may affirm on alternative bases either
argued by the parties or (sometimes) apparent to them on
the face of the record. See, e.g., SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318
U. S. 80, 88 (1943) (noting “the settled rule that, in review-
ing the decision of a lower court, it must be affirmed if the
result is correct ‘although the lower court relied upon a
wrong ground or gave a wrong reason’ ”); Wood, supra, at
473. And a busy appellate court sometimes may not see
the profit in devoting its limited resources to explaining
the error and the alternative basis for affirming when the
outcome is sure to remain the same, so it issues a sum-
mary affirmance instead. To reflect these realities, this
Court has traditionally warned readers against presuming
6                    WILSON v. SELLERS

                    GORSUCH, J., dissenting

our summary affirmance orders rest on reasons articulated
in lower court opinions. Comptroller of Treasury of Md.
v. Wynne, 575 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2015) (slip op., at 16–17)
(“ ‘[A] summary affirmance is an affirmance of the judg-
ment only,’ and ‘the rationale of the affirmance may not be
gleaned solely from the opinion below’ ”); Mandel v. Brad-
ley, 432 U. S. 173, 176 (1977) (per curiam). The courts of
appeals have issued similar warnings for similar reasons
about their own summary orders. See, e.g., Rates Tech-
nology, Inc. v. Mediatrix Telecom, Inc., 688 F. 3d 742, 750
(CA Fed. 2012); DeShong v. Seaboard Coast Line R. Co.,
737 F. 2d 1520, 1523 (CA11 1984). And respect for this
traditional principle of appellate practice surely weighs
against presuming a state court’s summary disposition
rests solely on a lower court’s opinion. On what account
could we reasonably demand more respect for our sum-
mary decisions than we are willing to extend to those of
our state court colleagues?
    Petitioner and the Court offer only this tepid reply.
They suggest that their “look through” presumption seeks
to reflect “realistic[ally]” the basis on which the state
summary decision rests. See Brief for Petitioner 44; ante,
at 7. But to the extent this is a claim that their presump-
tion comports realistically with longstanding traditions of
appellate practice, it is wrong for the reasons just laid out.
In fact, applying traditional understandings of appellate
practice, this Court has refused to presume that state
appellate courts even read lower court opinions rather
than just the briefs before them. See Baldwin v. Reese,
541 U. S. 27, 31 (2004). And surely it is a mystery how the
Court might today presume state supreme courts rely on
that which it traditionally presumes they do not read.
    If the argument here is instead an empirical claim that
the “look through” presumption comports realistically with
what happened in this case and others like it, it is wrong
too. Petitioner was convicted in Georgia. And during the

pendency of this case in our Court, the Georgia Supreme
Court issued an order confirming that lower courts in that
State may not “presum[e] that when this Court summarily
denies an application to appeal an order denying habeas
corpus relief, we necessarily agree with everything said in
that order.” Redmon v. Johnson, 809 S. E. 2d 468, 472
(Ga. 2018). The court explained that it has long followed
just this rule for all the reasons you’d expect. It inde-
pendently reviews the facts and law in each habeas case.
If it finds something it thinks might amount to a conse-
quential error, the court sets the case for argument and
usually prepares a full opinion. But “[o]n many occa-
sions,” the court finds only “inconsequential errors.” Id.,
at 471. 2 And in these cases the court normally issues a
——————
  2 Inlanguage that will sound familiar to all judges and lawyers in-
volved in litigating habeas claims, the Georgia Supreme Court ex-
plained that “[t]here are many examples of inconsequential errors, but
among the most common are the following:
  • The habeas court rejects a claim both on a procedural ground and,
    alternatively, on the substantive merits. This Court determines
    that one of those rulings appears factually or legally erroneous, but
    the other is correct, so an appeal would result in the habeas court’s
    judgment being affirmed on the correct ground.
  • In addressing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim under
    Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), the habeas court
    rules that counsel did not perform deficiently as alleged. That rul-
    ing appears to be erroneous, but this Court determines based on
    our review of the record that no prejudice resulted from the defi-
    cient performance, so an appeal would result in affirming the ha-
    beas court’s judgment. See id., at 697; Rozier v. Caldwell, 300 Ga.
    30, 31–32 (2016).
  • In addressing other claims that require the petitioner to prove each
    element of a multi-part test, such as a claim under Brady v. Mary-
    land, 373 U. S. 83 (1963), the habeas court makes factual or legal
    errors regarding the petitioner’s proof of one element but correctly
    concludes (or the record clearly shows) that the petitioner has not
    proved another required element. An appeal would result in this
    Court’s affirming the habeas court’s judgment.
8                        WILSON v. SELLERS

summary affirmance because the costs associated with full
treatment of the appeal outweigh the benefits of correcting
what is at most harmless error, especially given the court’s
heavy caseload and the need to attend to more consequen-
tial matters. 3 Petitioner’s presumption thus does not seek
to reflect reality; it seeks to deny it.
   The presumption is especially unrealistic in another
way. The Court and petitioner presume that a summary
order by a state supreme court adopts all the specific
reasons expressed by a lower state court. In doing so, they
disregard a far more realistic possibility: that the state
supreme court might have relied only on the same grounds
for the denial of relief as did the lower court without nec-
essarily adopting all its reasoning. Here, the lower state
court denied petitioner’s Strickland claim on the grounds
that counsel’s performance was not deficient and peti-
tioner suffered no prejudice. And it gave several reasons for

——————
    •The habeas court misstates a legal standard in one part of its or-
     der, but recites the standard correctly elsewhere in the order, and
     it is clear that the judgment is correct applying the right standard.
  • In addressing a habeas petition with multitudinous claims, the
     habeas court’s order fails to explicitly rule on a claim, but the rec-
     ord shows that the claim is entirely meritless.” Redmon, 809
     S. E. 2d, at 471 (some citations omitted).
  3 “[T]he burdens of invoking the full appellate process, including writ-

ing opinions simply to point out factual or legal errors that do not affect
the judgment, are significant for this Court. We issue about 350
published opinions each year, all en banc, meaning that each Justice
(seven of us until 2017, nine now) must evaluate an opinion a day and
author 35 to 50 majority opinions a year, with the help of only two law
clerks in each chambers. Moreover, the Georgia Constitution requires
this Court to issue its decision within the two terms of court after an
appeal is docketed (which means within about eight months, given our
three terms per year). . . . And our reasoned decisions are precedent
binding on all other Georgia courts, . . . so issuing opinions where the
relevant law is already well-established runs the risk of creating
inconsistencies.” Redmon, 809 S. E. 2d, at 472.

its conclusions: for example, the evidence petitioner sought
to admit “would have been inadmissible on evidentiary
grounds, cumulative of other testimony, or otherwise
would not have, in reasonable probability, changed the
outcome of the trial.” App. 61. In summarily denying
relief, the state supreme court might have reached the
same conclusions (no deficient performance and no preju-
dice) without resting on the exact same reasons.
   While the “look through” presumption cannot be
squared with AEDPA’s text, traditional rules, or Georgia’s
actual practice, petitioner and the Court contend it is at
least consistent with Ylst v. Nunnemaker, 501 U. S. 797
(1991). See Brief for Petitioner 38; ante, at 5–8. But it is
not. In habeas review of state court convictions, federal
courts may only review questions of federal law. So if a
state court decision rejecting a petitioner’s federal law
claim rests on a state procedural defect (say the petitioner
filed too late under state rules), federal courts generally
have no authority to reach the federal claim. Ylst simply
teaches that, if a lower state court opinion expressly relied
on an independent and adequate state ground, we should
presume a later state appellate court summary disposition
invoked it too. See 501 U. S., at 801, 803. The decision
thus seeks to protect state court decisions from displace-
ment and reaches a result consistent with the traditional
rule that a summary order invokes all fairly presented
bases for affirmance.
   Neither can Ylst be reimagined today as meaning any-
thing more. The case came years before AEDPA’s new
standards for habeas review and can offer nothing useful
about them. The work of interpreting AEDPA’s demands
was left instead to Richter. And, as we’ve seen, Richter
forecloses petitioner’s presumption. Of course, and as
petitioner stresses, Richter didn’t overrule Ylst. But that’s
for the simple reason that Ylst continues to do important,
if limited, work in the disposition of procedural default
10                  WILSON v. SELLERS

                   GORSUCH, J., dissenting

claims because “AEDPA did not change the application of
pre-AEDPA procedural default principles.” B. Means,
Federal Habeas Manual §9B:3 (2017).
   Uncomfortable questions follow too from any effort to
reimagine Ylst. If we were to take Ylst as suggesting that
summary decisions presumptively rely only on the reasons
found in lower court opinions, wouldn’t we have to over-
rule our many precedents like Wynne and Mandel that
explicitly reject any such presumption? Wouldn’t circuit
courts have to discard their own similar precedents? See
supra, at 5–6. Consistency would seem to demand no less.
   The only answer petitioner and the Court offer is no
answer at all. Consistency, they suggest, is overrated.
Everywhere else in the law we should retain the usual rule
that a summary affirmance can’t be read as presumptively
resting on the lower court’s reasons. They encourage us to
use Ylst only as a tool for making a special exception for
AEDPA cases: here and here alone should we adopt peti-
tioner’s “look through” presumption. Brief for Petitioner
18, 20; ante, at 10 (stating that “we ‘look through’ the
silent decision for a specific and narrow purpose” under
AEDPA). But just stating this good-for-habeas-only rule
should be enough to reject it. Summary orders that hap-
pen to arise in state habeas cases should receive no less
respect than those that arise anywhere else in the law. If
anything, they should receive more respect, because federal
habeas review of state court decisions “ ‘intrudes on
state sovereignty to a degree matched by few exercises of
federal judicial authority.’ ” Richter, 562 U. S., at 103.
                             *
  Petitioner’s novel presumption not only lacks any prov-
enance in the law, it promises nothing for its trouble.
Consider the most obvious question it invites, one sug-
gested by the facts of our own case: what happens when a
state supreme court issues an order explaining that its
                 Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)          11

                    GORSUCH, J., dissenting

summary affirmances do not necessarily adopt the reasons
in lower court opinions? Should that be enough to rebut
the “look through” presumption? After defending the
presumption, even the dissent in the Eleventh Circuit
decision under review recognized that a disclaimer along
these lines should suffice to rebut it. See Wilson v. War-
den, 834 F. 3d 1227, 1263 (2016) (en banc) (opinion of J.
Pryor, J.) (“The Georgia Supreme Court could simply issue
a one-line order denying an application for a certificate of
probable cause that indicates agreement with the result
the superior court reached but not the lower court’s rea-
sons for rejecting the petitioner’s claim”). And, of course,
the Georgia Supreme Court has recently responded to the
dissent’s invitation by issuing just such a disclaimer. So
in the end petitioner’s presumption seems likely to accom-
plish nothing for him and only needless work for others—
inducing more state supreme courts to churn out more
orders restating the obvious fact that their summary
dispositions don’t necessarily rest on the reasons given by
lower courts. Along the way, too, it seems federal courts
will have their hands full. For while the Eleventh Circuit
dissent had no difficulty acknowledging that an order like
Georgia’s suffices to overcome petitioner’s presumption,
the Court today refuses to supply the same obvious
answer.
  Consider, too, the questions that would follow in the
unlikely event a general order like the one from the Geor-
gia Supreme Court wasn’t considered enough to overcome
petitioner’s presumption. Quickly federal courts would be
forced to decide: does the “look through” presumption
survive even when a state supreme court includes lan-
guage in every summary order explaining that its decision
does not necessarily adopt the reasoning below? What if
the state supreme court says something slightly different
but to the same effect, declaring in each case that it has
independently considered the relevant law and evidence
12                  WILSON v. SELLERS

                    GORSUCH, J., dissenting

before denying relief? And if we start dictating what state
court disclaimers should look like and where they should
appear, what exactly is left of Congress’s direction that
our review is intended to guard only against “ ‘extreme
malfunctions’ ” in state criminal justice systems? Richter,
supra, at 102. Wouldn’t we be slipping into the business of
“tell[ing] state courts how they must write their opinions,”
something this Court has long said federal habeas courts
“have no power” to do? Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S.
722, 739 (1991).
   Apart from whether a (general or case-specific) order
from a state supreme court suffices to overcome petition-
er’s presumption, there’s the question what else might.
Say a lower state court opinion includes an error but the
legal briefs or other submissions presented to the state
supreme court supply sound alternative bases for affir-
mance. In those circumstances, should a federal habeas
court really presume that the state supreme court chose to
repeat the lower court’s mistake rather than rely on the
solid grounds argued to it by the parties? What if a sound
alternative basis for affirmance is presented for the first
time in the parties’ federal habeas submissions: are we to
presume that the state supreme court was somehow less
able to identify a reasonable basis for affirmance than
federal habeas counsel?
   Here at least the Court does offer an answer. Petitioner
insists that federal courts should presume that state
supreme court summary orders rest on unreasonable lower
state court opinions even in the face of reasonable alterna-
tive arguments presented to the state supreme court or in
federal habeas proceedings. But seeming to recognize the
unreasonableness of this request, the Court opts to re-
shape radically petitioner’s proposed presumption before
adopting it. First, the Court states that “it is more likely
that a state supreme court’s single word ‘affirm’ rests upon
alternative grounds where the lower state court decision is
                 Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)          13

                    GORSUCH, J., dissenting

unreasonable.” Ante, at 9. Then, the Court proceeds to
explain that “a federal habeas court may conclude that
counsel has rebutted the presumption on the basis of
convincing alternative arguments for affirmance made to
the State’s highest court or equivalent evidence presented
in its briefing to the federal court similarly establishing
that the State’s highest court relied on a different ground
than the lower state court, such as the existence of a valid
ground for affirmance that is obvious from the state-court
record.” Ibid.
   The Court’s reshaping of petitioner’s presumption re-
veals just how futile this whole business really is. If, as
the Court holds, the “look through” presumption can be
rebutted “where the lower state court decision is unrea-
sonable,” ibid., it’s hard to see what good it does. Peti-
tioner sought to assign unreasonable lower court opinions to
final state court summary decisions. To hear now that
essentially only reasonable (and so sustainable) lower
state court opinions are presumptively adopted by final
state court summary decisions will surely leave him sour
on this journey and federal habeas courts scratching their
heads about the point of it all. And if, as the Court also
tells us, a federal habeas court can always deny relief on a
basis that is apparent from the record or on the basis of
alternative arguments presented by the parties in state or
federal proceedings, then the “look through” presumption
truly means nothing and we are back where we started.
With the Court’s revisions to petitioner’s presumption, a
federal habeas court is neither obliged to look through
exclusively to the reasons given by a lower state court, nor
required to presume that a summary order adopts those
reasons.
   All this is welcome news of a sort. The Court may prom-
ise us a future of foraging through presumptions and
rebuttals. But at least at the end of it we rest knowing
that what was true before remains true today: a federal
14                  WILSON v. SELLERS

                    GORSUCH, J., dissenting

habeas court should look at all the arguments presented in
state and federal court and examine the state court record.
And a federal habeas court should sustain a state court
summary decision denying relief if those materials reveal
a basis to do so reasonably consistent with this Court’s
holdings. Exactly what a federal court applying the stat-
ute and Richter has had to do all along. See supra, at 2–5.
And exactly what the Eleventh Circuit correctly held it
had to do in this case.
                              *
   Today, petitioner invites us to adopt a novel presump-
tion that AEDPA, traditional principles of appellate re-
view, and Georgia practice all preclude. It’s an invitation
that requires us to treat the work of state court colleagues
with disrespect we would not tolerate for our own. And all
to what end? None at all, it turns out. As modified by the
Court, petitioner’s presumption nearly drops us back
where we began, with only trouble to show for the effort.
Respectfully, I would decline the invitation to this circui-
tous journey and just affirm.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT

    No. 16–1362. Argued January 17, 2018—Decided April 2, 2018
Respondents, current and former service advisors for petitioner Encino
  Motorcars, LLC, sued petitioner for backpay, alleging that petitioner
  violated the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) by failing to pay them
  overtime. Petitioner moved to dismiss, arguing that service advisors
  are exempt from the FLSA’s overtime-pay requirement under </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">29</span>
  <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §213(b)(10)(A), which applies to “any salesman, partsman, or
  mechanic primarily engaged in selling or servicing automobiles,
  trucks, or farm implements.” The District Court agreed and dis-
  missed the suit. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.
  It found the statute ambiguous and the legislative history inconclu-
  sive, and it deferred to a 2011 Department of Labor rule that inter-
  preted “salesman” to exclude service advisors. This Court vacated
  the Ninth Circuit’s judgment, holding that courts could not defer to
  the procedurally defective 2011 rule, Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Na-
  varro, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">579</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">___, ___–___ (Encino I), but not deciding whether the
  exemption covers service advisors, id., at ___. On remand, the Ninth
  Circuit again held that the exemption does not include service advi-
  sors.
Held: Because service advisors are “salesm[e]n . . . primarily engaged in
 . . . servicing automobiles,” they are exempt from the FLSA’s over-
 time-pay requirement. Pp. 5–11.
     (a) A service advisor is obviously a “salesman.” The ordinary
 meaning of “salesman” is someone who sells goods or services, and
 service advisors “sell [customers] services for their vehicles,” Encino
 I, supra, at ___. P. 6.
     (b) Service advisors are also “primarily engaged in . . . servicing au-
 tomobiles.” “Servicing” can mean either “the action of maintaining or
 repairing a motor vehicle” or “[t]he action of providing a service.” 15
2               ENCINO MOTORCARS, LLC v. NAVARRO

                                  Syllabus

    Oxford English Dictionary 39. Service advisors satisfy both defini-
    tions because they are integral to the servicing process. They “mee[t]
    customers; liste[n] to their concerns about their cars; sugges[t] repair
    and maintenance services; sel[l] new accessories or replacement
    parts; recor[d] service orders; follo[w] up with customers as the ser-
    vices are performed (for instance, if new problems are discovered);
    and explai[n] the repair and maintenance work when customers re-
    turn for their vehicles.” Encino I, supra, at ___. While service advi-
    sors do not spend most of their time physically repairing automobiles,
    neither do partsmen, who the parties agree are “primarily engaged in
    . . . servicing automobiles.” Pp. 6–7.
        (c) The Ninth Circuit invoked the distributive canon—matching
    “salesman” with “selling” and “partsman [and] mechanic” with “[ser-
    vicing]”—to conclude that the exemption simply does not apply to
    “salesm[e]n . . . primarily engaged in . . . servicing automobiles.” But
    the word “or,” which connects all of the exemption’s nouns and ger-
    unds, is “almost always disjunctive.” United States v. Woods, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">571</span>
    <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">31</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 45. Using “or” to join “selling” and “servicing” thus suggests
    that the exemption covers a salesman primarily engaged in either ac-
    tivity.
         Statutory context supports this reading. First, the distributive
    canon has the most force when one-to-one matching is present, but
    here, the statute would require matching some of three nouns with
    one of two gerunds. Second, the distributive canon has the most force
    when an ordinary, disjunctive reading is linguistically impossible.
    But here, “salesman . . . primarily engaged in . . . servicing automo-
    biles” is an apt description of a service advisor. Third, a narrow dis-
    tributive phrasing is an unnatural fit here because the entire exemp-
    tion bespeaks breadth, starting with “any” and using the disjunctive
    “or” three times. Pp. 7–9.
        (d) The Ninth Circuit also invoked the principle that exemptions to
    the FLSA should be construed narrowly. But the Court rejects this
    principle as a guide to interpreting the FLSA. Because the FLSA
    gives no textual indication that its exemptions should be construed
    narrowly, they should be given a fair reading. P. 9.
        (e) Finally, the Ninth Circuit’s reliance on two extraneous sources
    to support its interpretation—the 1966–1967 Occupational Outlook
    Handbook and the FLSA’s legislative history—is unavailing. Pp. 9–
    11.

 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

                                [April 2, 2018]


  JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.
  The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 52 Stat. 1060, as
amended, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">29</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §201 et seq., requires employers to
pay overtime compensation to covered employees. The
FLSA exempts from the overtime-pay requirement “any
salesman, partsman, or mechanic primarily engaged in
selling or servicing automobiles” at a covered dealership.
§213(b)(10)(A). We granted certiorari to decide whether
this exemption applies to service advisors—employees at
car dealerships who consult with customers about their
servicing needs and sell them servicing solutions. We
conclude that service advisors are exempt.
                            I

                            A

  Enacted in 1938, the FLSA requires employers to pay
overtime to covered employees who work more than 40
hours in a week. </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">29</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §207(a). But the FLSA ex­
empts many categories of employees from this require­
ment. See §213. Employees at car dealerships have long
been among those exempted.
  Congress initially exempted all employees at car dealer­
2          ENCINO MOTORCARS, LLC v. NAVARRO

                     Opinion of the Court

ships from the overtime-pay requirement. See Fair Labor
Standards Amendments of 1961, §9, 75 Stat. 73. Congress
then narrowed that exemption to cover “any salesman,
partsman, or mechanic primarily engaged in selling or
servicing automobiles, trailers, trucks, farm implements,
or aircraft.” Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1966,
§209, 80 Stat. 836. In 1974, Congress enacted the version
of the exemption at issue here. It provides that the
FLSA’s overtime-pay requirement does not apply to “any
salesman, partsman, or mechanic primarily engaged in
selling or servicing automobiles, trucks, or farm imple­
ments, if he is employed by a nonmanufacturing estab­
lishment primarily engaged in the business of selling such
vehicles or implements to ultimate purchasers.”
§213(b)(10)(A).
   This language has long been understood to cover service
advisors. Although the Department of Labor initially
interpreted it to exclude them, 35 Fed. Reg. 5896 (1970)
(codified at 29 CFR §779.372(c)(4) (1971)), the federal
courts rejected that view, see Brennan v. Deel Motors, Inc.,

(table). After these decisions, the Department issued an
opinion letter in 1978, explaining that service advisors are
exempt in most cases. See Dept. of Labor, Wage & Hour
Div., Opinion Letter No. 1520 (WH–467) (1978), [1978–
1981 Transfer Binder] CCH Wages–Hours Administrative
Rulings ¶31,207. From 1978 to 2011, Congress made no
changes to the exemption, despite amending §213 nearly a
dozen times. The Department also continued to acquiesce
in the view that service advisors are exempt. See Dept. of
Labor, Wage & Hour Div., Field Operations Handbook,

                      Opinion of the Court

   In 2011, however, the Department reversed course. It
issued a rule that interpreted “salesman” to exclude ser­
vice advisors. 76 Fed. Reg. 18832, 18859 (2011) (codified
at 29 CFR §779.372(c)). That regulation prompted this
litigation.
                               B
   Petitioner Encino Motorcars, LLC, is a Mercedes-Benz
dealership in California. Respondents are current and
former service advisors for petitioner. Service advisors
“interact with customers and sell them services for their
vehicles.” Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">579</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span>
<span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">___, ___ (2016) (Encino I) (slip op., at 2). They “mee[t]
customers; liste[n] to their concerns about their cars;
sugges[t] repair and maintenance services; sel[l] new
accessories or replacement parts; recor[d] service orders;
follo[w] up with customers as the services are performed
(for instance, if new problems are discovered); and ex­
plai[n] the repair and maintenance work when customers
return for their vehicles.” Ibid.
   In 2012, respondents sued petitioner for backpay. Rely­
ing on the Department’s 2011 regulation, respondents
alleged that petitioner had violated the FLSA by failing to
pay them overtime. Petitioner moved to dismiss, arguing
that service advisors are exempt under §213(b)(10)(A).
The District Court agreed with petitioner and dismissed
the complaint, but the Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit reversed. Finding the text ambiguous and the
legislative history “inconclusive,” the Ninth Circuit de­
ferred to the Department’s 2011 rule under Chevron
U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,
</pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""111221""><a href=""/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/""><span class=""volume"">467</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">837</span></a></span><pre class=""inline""> (1984).

   We granted certiorari and vacated the Ninth Circuit’s
judgment. We explained that courts cannot defer to the
2011 rule because it is procedurally defective. See Encino
I, 579 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 8–12). Specifically, the
4           ENCINO MOTORCARS, LLC v. NAVARRO

                      Opinion of the Court

regulation undermined significant reliance interests in the
automobile industry by changing the treatment of service
advisors without a sufficiently reasoned explanation. Id.,
at ___ (slip op., at 10). But we did not decide whether,
without administrative deference, the exemption covers
service advisors. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 12). We remanded
that issue for the Ninth Circuit to address in the first
instance. Ibid.
                               C
  On remand, the Ninth Circuit again held that the ex­
emption does not include service advisors. The Court of
Appeals agreed that a service advisor is a “ ‘salesman’ ” in
a “generic sense,” </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">845</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.3d</span> <span class=""page"">925</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 930 (2017), and is “ ‘pri­
marily engaged in . . . servicing automobiles’ ” in a “general
sense,” id., at 931. Nonetheless, it concluded that “Con­
gress did not intend to exempt service advisors.” Id., at
929.
  The Ninth Circuit began by noting that the Depart­
ment’s 1966–1967 Occupational Outlook Handbook listed
12 job titles in the table of contents that could be found at
a car dealership, including “automobile mechanics,” “au­
tomobile parts countermen,” “automobile salesmen,” and
“automobile service advisors.” Id., at 930. Because the
FLSA exemption listed three of these positions, but not
service advisors, the Ninth Circuit concluded that service
advisors are not exempt. Ibid. The Ninth Circuit also
determined that service advisors are not primarily en­
gaged in “servicing” automobiles, which it defined to mean
“only those who are actually occupied in the repair and
maintenance of cars.” Id., at 931. And the Ninth Circuit
further concluded that the exemption does not cover
salesmen who are primarily engaged in servicing. Id., at
933. In reaching this conclusion, the Ninth Circuit in­
voked the distributive canon. See A. Scalia & B. Garner,
Reading Law 214 (2012) (“Distributive phrasing applies
                 Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)            5

                     Opinion of the Court

each expression to its appropriate referent”). It reasoned
that “Congress intended the gerunds—selling and servic­
ing—to be distributed to their appropriate subjects—
salesman, partsman, and mechanic. A salesman sells; a
partsman services; and a mechanic services.” Id., at 934.
Finally, the Court of Appeals noted that its interpretation
was supported by the principle that exemptions to the
FLSA should be construed narrowly, id., at 935, and the
lack of any “mention of service advisors” in the legislative
history, id., at 939.
  We granted certiorari, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">582</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">___ (2017), and now
reverse.
                               II
    The FLSA exempts from its overtime-pay requirement
“any salesman, partsman, or mechanic primarily engaged
in selling or servicing automobiles, trucks, or farm imple­
ments, if he is employed by a nonmanufacturing estab­
lishment primarily engaged in the business of selling such
vehicles or implements to ultimate purchasers.”
§213(b)(10)(A). The parties agree that petitioner is a
“nonmanufacturing establishment primarily engaged in
the business of selling [automobiles] to ultimate purchas­
ers.” The parties also agree that a service advisor is not a
“partsman” or “mechanic,” and that a service advisor is
not “primarily engaged . . . in selling automobiles.” The
question, then, is whether service advisors are “salesm[e]n
. . . primarily engaged in . . . servicing automobiles.” We
conclude that they are. Under the best reading of the text,
service advisors are “salesm[e]n,” and they are “primarily
engaged in . . . servicing automobiles.” The distributive
canon, the practice of construing FLSA exemptions nar­
rowly, and the legislative history do not persuade us
otherwise.
6           ENCINO MOTORCARS, LLC v. NAVARRO

                      Opinion of the Court 


                              A

  A service advisor is obviously a “salesman.” The term
“salesman” is not defined in the statute, so “we give the
term its ordinary meaning.” Taniguchi v. Kan Pacific
Saipan, Ltd., </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">566</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">560</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 566 (2012). The ordinary
meaning of “salesman” is someone who sells goods or
services. See 14 Oxford English Dictionary 391 (2d ed.
1989) (“[a] man whose business it is to sell goods or con­
duct sales”); Random House Dictionary of the English
Language 1262 (1966) (“a man who sells goods, services,
etc.”). Service advisors do precisely that. As this Court
previously explained, service advisors “sell [customers]
services for their vehicles.” Encino I, 579 U. S., at ___ (slip
op., at 2).
                                B
  Service advisors are also “primarily engaged in . . .
servicing automobiles.” §213(b)(10)(A). The word “servic­
ing” in this context can mean either “the action of main­
taining or repairing a motor vehicle” or “[t]he action of
providing a service.” 15 Oxford English Dictionary, at 39;
see also Random House Dictionary of the English Lan­
guage, at 1304 (“to make fit for use; repair; restore to
condition for service”). Service advisors satisfy both defi­
nitions. Service advisors are integral to the servicing
process. They “mee[t] customers; liste[n] to their concerns
about their cars; sugges[t] repair and maintenance ser­
vices; sel[l] new accessories or replacement parts; recor[d]
service orders; follo[w] up with customers as the services
are performed (for instance, if new problems are discov­
ered); and explai[n] the repair and maintenance work
when customers return for their vehicles.” Encino I, su-
pra, at ___ (slip op., at 2). If you ask the average customer
who services his car, the primary, and perhaps only, per­
son he is likely to identify is his service advisor.
  True, service advisors do not spend most of their time
                  Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)              7

                      Opinion of the Court

physically repairing automobiles. But the statutory lan­
guage is not so constrained. All agree that partsmen, for
example, are “primarily engaged in . . . servicing automo­
biles.” Brief for Petitioner 40; Brief for Respondents 41–
44. But partsmen, like service advisors, do not spend most
of their time under the hood. Instead, they “obtain the
vehicle parts . . . and provide those parts to the mechan­
ics.” Encino I, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 2); see also 1 Dept.
of Labor, Dictionary of Occupational Titles 33 (3d ed.
1965) (defining “partsman” as someone who “[p]urchases,
stores, and issues spare parts for automotive and indus­
trial equipment”). In other words, the phrase “primarily
engaged in . . . servicing automobiles” must include some
individuals who do not physically repair automobiles
themselves but who are integrally involved in the servic­
ing process. That description applies to partsmen and
service advisors alike.
                             C
   The Ninth Circuit concluded that service advisors are
not covered because the exemption simply does not apply
to “salesm[e]n . . . primarily engaged in . . . servicing
automobiles.” The Ninth Circuit invoked the distributive
canon to reach this conclusion. Using that canon, it
matched “salesman” with “selling” and “partsma[n] [and]
mechanic” with “servicing.” We reject this reasoning.
   The text of the exemption covers “any salesman, parts-
man, or mechanic primarily engaged in selling or servicing
automobiles, trucks, or farm implements.” §213(b)(10)(A).
The exemption uses the word “or” to connect all of its
nouns and gerunds, and “or” is “almost always disjunc­
tive.” United States v. Woods, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">571</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">31</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 45 (2013).
Thus, the use of “or” to join “selling” and “servicing” sug­
gests that the exemption covers a salesman primarily
engaged in either activity.
   Unsurprisingly, statutory context can overcome the
8           ENCINO MOTORCARS, LLC v. NAVARRO

                      Opinion of the Court

ordinary, disjunctive meaning of “or.” The distributive
canon, for example, recognizes that sometimes “[w]here a
sentence contains several antecedents and several conse­
quents,” courts should “read them distributively and apply
the words to the subjects which, by context, they seem
most properly to relate.” 2A N. Singer & S. Singer, Suth­
erland Statutes and Statutory Construction §47:26, p. 448
(rev. 7th ed. 2014).
   But here, context favors the ordinary disjunctive mean­
ing of “or” for at least three reasons. First, the distribu­
tive canon has the most force when the statute allows for
one-to-one matching. But here, the distributive canon
would mix and match some of three nouns—“salesman,
partsman, or mechanic”—with one of two gerunds—
“selling or servicing.” §213(b)(10)(A). We doubt that a
legislative drafter would leave it to the reader to figure out
the precise combinations. Second, the distributive canon
has the most force when an ordinary, disjunctive reading
is linguistically impossible. Cf., e.g., Huidekoper’s Lessee
v. Douglass, 3 Cranch 1, 67 (1805) (Marshall, C. J.) (apply­
ing the distributive canon when a purely disjunctive read­
ing “would involve a contradiction in terms”). But as
explained above, the phrase “salesman . . . primarily
engaged in . . . servicing automobiles” not only makes
sense; it is an apt description of a service advisor. Third, a
narrow distributive phrasing is an unnatural fit here
because the entire exemption bespeaks breadth. It begins
with the word “any.” See Ali v. Federal Bureau of Prisons,
</pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""145834""><a href=""/opinion/145834/ali-v-federal-bureau-of-prisons/""><span class=""volume"">552</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">214</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 219 (2008) (noting the “expansive meaning”
of “any”). And it uses the disjunctive word “or” three
times. In fact, all agree that the third list in the exemp­
tion—“automobiles, trucks, or farm implements”—
modifies every other noun and gerund. But it would be
odd to read the exemption as starting with a distributive
phrasing and then, halfway through and without warning,
switching to a disjunctive phrasing—all the while using

                      Opinion of the Court

FLSA’s purpose as the overtime-pay requirement. See id.,

                          E
  Finally, the Ninth Circuit relied on two extraneous
10          ENCINO MOTORCARS, LLC v. NAVARRO

                      Opinion of the Court

sources to support its interpretation: the Department’s
1966–1967 Occupational Outlook Handbook and the
FLSA’s legislative history. We find neither persuasive.
                             1
   The Ninth Circuit first relied on the Department’s
1966–1967 Occupational Outlook Handbook. It identified
12 jobs from the Handbook’s table of contents that it
thought could be found at automobile dealerships. See
</pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">845</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.</span> <span class=""page"">3d</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, at 930. The Ninth Circuit then stressed that
the exemption aligns with three of those job titles—
“[a]utomobile mechanics,” “[a]utomobile parts counter­
men,” and “[a]utomobile salesmen”—but not “[a]utomobile
service advisors.” Ibid.
   The Ninth Circuit cited nothing, however, suggesting
that the exemption was meant to align with the job titles
listed in the Handbook. To the contrary, the exemption
applies to “any salesman . . . primarily engaged in selling
or servicing automobiles.” It is not limited, like the term
in the Handbook, to “automobile salesmen.” And the
ordinary meaning of “salesman” plainly includes service
advisors.
                                2
   The Ninth Circuit also relied on legislative history to
support its interpretation. See id., at 936–939. Specifi-
cally, it noted that the legislative history discusses “automo­
bile salesmen, partsmen, and mechanics” but never dis­
cusses service advisors. Id., at 939. Although the Ninth
Circuit had previously found that same legislative history
“inconclusive,” Encino, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">780</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.</span> <span class=""page"">3d</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, at 1275, on remand it

   The Ninth Circuit was right the first time. As we have
explained, the best reading of the statute is that service

advisors are exempt. Even for those Members of this
Court who consider legislative history, silence in the legis­
lative history, “no matter how ‘clanging,’ ” cannot defeat
the better reading of the text and statutory context.

(1985). If the text is clear, it needs no repetition in the
legislative history; and if the text is ambiguous, silence in
the legislative history cannot lend any clarity. See Avco

                         *     *    *
  In sum, we conclude that service advisors are exempt
from the overtime-pay requirement of the FLSA because
they are “salesm[e]n . . . primarily engaged in . . . servicing
automobiles.” §213(b)(10)(A). Accordingly, we reverse the
judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

                                                   It is so ordered.

 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

                        [April 2, 2018]


  JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE BREYER,
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, and JUSTICE KAGAN join, dissenting.
  Diverse categories of employees staff automobile dealer­
ships. Of employees so engaged, Congress explicitly ex­
empted from the Fair Labor Standards Act hours re­
quirements only three occupations: salesmen, partsmen,
and mechanics. The Court today approves the exemption
of a fourth occupation: automobile service advisors. In
accord with the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit, I would not enlarge the exemption to in­
clude service advisors or other occupations outside Con­
gress’ enumeration.
  Respondents are service advisors at a Mercedes-Benz
automobile dealership in the Los Angeles area. They work
regular hours, 7 a.m. to 6 p.m., at least five days per week,
on the dealership premises. App. 54. Their weekly mini­
mum is 55 hours. Maximum hours, for workers covered by
the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA or Act), are 40 per
week. </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">29</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §207(a)(1). In this action, respondents
seek time-and-a-half compensation for hours worked
beyond the 40 per week maximum prescribed by the
FLSA.
  The question presented: Are service advisors exempt
from receipt of overtime compensation under </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">29</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">.
§213(b)(10)(A)? That exemption covers “any salesman,

                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting

partsman, or mechanic primarily engaged in selling or
servicing automobiles.” Service advisors, such as respond­
ents, neither sell automobiles nor service (i.e., repair or
maintain) vehicles. Rather, they “meet and greet [car]
owners”; “solicit and sugges[t]” repair services “to remedy
the [owner’s] complaints”; “solicit and suggest . . . supple­
mental [vehicle] service[s]”; and provide owners with cost
estimates. App. 55. Because service advisors neither sell
nor repair automobiles, they should remain outside the
exemption and within the Act’s coverage.
                             I
  In 1961, Congress exempted all automobile-dealership
employees from the Act’s overtime-pay requirements. See
Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1961, §9, 75 Stat.
73.1 Five years later, in 1966, Congress confined the
dealership exemption to three categories of employees:
automobile salesmen, mechanics, and partsmen. See Fair
Labor Standards Amendments of 1966, §209, 80 Stat. 836.
At the time, it was well understood that mechanics per­
form “preventive maintenance” and “repairs,” Dept. of
Labor, Occupational Outlook Handbook 477 (1966–1967
ed.) (Handbook), while partsmen requisition parts,
“suppl[y] [them] to mechanics,” id., at 312, and, at times,
have “mechanical responsibilities in repairing parts,” Brief
for International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers, AFL–CIO, as Amicus Curiae 30; see Handbook,
at 312–313 (partsmen may “measure parts for inter­
changeability,” test parts for “defect[s],” and “repair
——————
   1 The exemption further extended to all employees of establishments

selling “trucks” and “farm implements.”        Fair Labor Standards
Amendments of 1961, §9, 75 Stat. 73. When Congress later narrowed
the provision’s scope for automobile-dealership employees, it similarly
diminished the exemption’s application to workers at truck and farm-
implement dealerships. See, e.g., Fair Labor Standards Amendments
of 1966, §209, 80 Stat. 836.

parts”). Congress did not exempt numerous other catego­
ries of dealership employees, among them, automobile
painters, upholsterers, bookkeeping workers, cashiers,
janitors, purchasing agents, shipping and receiving clerks,
and, most relevant here, service advisors. These positions
and their duties were well known at the time, as docu­
mented in U. S. Government catalogs of American jobs.
See Handbook, at XIII, XV, XVI (table of contents); Brief
for International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers, AFL–CIO, as Amicus Curiae 34 (noting “more
than twenty distinct [job] classifications” in the service
department alone).
   “Where Congress explicitly enumerates certain excep­
tions . . . , additional exceptions are not to be implied, in
the absence of evidence of a contrary legislative intent.”

quotation marks omitted). The Court thus has no warrant
to add to the three explicitly exempt categories (salesmen,
partsmen, and mechanics) a fourth (service advisors) for
which the Legislature did not provide. The reach of to­
day’s ruling is uncertain, troublingly so: By expansively
reading the exemption to encompass all salesmen, parts-
men, and mechanics who are “integral to the servicing
process,” ante, at 6, the Court risks restoring much of
what Congress intended the 1966 amendment to termi­
nate, i.e., the blanket exemption of all dealership employ­
ees from overtime-pay requirements.
                             II
  Had the §213(b)(10)(A) exemption covered “any sales­
man or mechanic primarily engaged in selling or servicing
automobiles,” there could be no argument that service
advisors fit within it. Only “salesmen” primarily engaged
in “selling” automobiles and “mechanics” primarily en­
gaged in “servicing” them would fall outside the Act’s
coverage. Service advisors, defined as “salesmen primarily

ing) (slip op., at 2) (emphasis added), plainly do not belong
in either category. Moreover, even if the exemption were
read to reach “salesmen” “primarily engaged in servicing
automobiles,” not just selling them, service advisors would
not be exempt. The ordinary meaning of “servicing” is “the
action of maintaining or repairing a motor vehicle.” Ante,
at 6 (quoting 15 Oxford English Dictionary 39 (2d ed.
1989)). As described above, see supra, at 2, service advi­
sors neither maintain nor repair automobiles.2
   Petitioner stakes its case on Congress’ addition of the
“partsman” job to the exemption. See Reply Brief 6–10.
That inclusion, petitioner urges, has a vacuum effect: It
draws into the exemption job categories other than the
three for which Congress provided, in particular, service
advisors. Because partsmen, like service advisors, neither
“sell” nor “service” automobiles in the conventional sense,
petitioner reasons, Congress must have intended the word
“service” to mean something broader than repair and
maintenance.
   To begin with, petitioner’s premise is flawed. Unlike
service advisors, partsmen “ ‘get their hands dirty’ by
‘working as a mechanic’s right-hand man or woman.’ ”

  2 Service advisors do not maintain or repair motor vehicles even if, as

the Court concludes, they are “integral to the servicing process.” Ante,
at 6. The Ninth Circuit provided an apt analogy: “[A] receptionist-
scheduler at a dental office fields calls from patients, matching their
needs (e.g., a broken tooth or jaw pain) with the appropriate provider,
appointment time, and length of anticipated service. That work is
integral to a patient’s obtaining dental services, but we would not say
that the receptionist-scheduler is ‘primarily engaged in’ cleaning teeth
or installing crowns.” </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">845</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.3d</span> <span class=""page"">925</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 932 (2017).

                         GINSBURG, J., dissenting

at 2–3 (describing duties of partsmen). As the Solicitor
General put it last time this case was before the Court, a
mechanic “might be able to obtain the parts to complete a
repair without the real-time assistance of a partsman by
his side.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in No.
15–415, p. 23. But dividing the “key [repair] tasks . . .
between two individuals” only “reinforces” “that both the
mechanic and the partsman are . . . involved in repairing
(‘servicing’) the vehicle.” Ibid. Service advisors, in con­
trast, “sell . . . services [to customers] for their vehicles,”
Encino Motorcars, 579 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2) (empha­
sis added)—services that are later performed by mechan­
ics and partsmen.
   Adding partsmen to the exemption, moreover, would be
an exceptionally odd way for Congress to have indicated
that “servicing” should be given a meaning deviating from
its ordinary usage. There is a more straightforward ex­
planation for Congress’ inclusion of partsmen alongside
salesmen and mechanics: Common features of the three
enumerated jobs make them unsuitable for overtime pay.
   Both salesmen and mechanics work irregular hours,
including nights and weekends, not uncommonly offsite,
rendering time worked not easily tracked.3 As noted in
the 1966 Senate floor debate, salesmen “go out at unusual
hours, trying to earn commissions.” 112 Cong. Rec. 20504
——————
   3 In addition to practical difficulties in calculating hours, a core pur­

pose of overtime may not be served when employees’ hours regularly
fluctuate. Enacted in the midst of the Great Depression, the FLSA
overtime rules encourage employers to hire more individuals who work
40-hour weeks, rather than maintaining a staff of fewer employees who
consistently work longer hours. See Overnight Motor Transp. Co. v.
Missel, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""103704""><a href=""/opinion/103704/overnight-motor-transp-co-v-missel/""><span class=""volume"">316</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">572</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 577–578 (1942) (overtime rules apply “financial
pressure” on employers to “spread employment”); 7 D. VanDeusen,
Labor and Employment Law §176.02[1] (2018). But if a position’s
working hours routinely ebb and flow, while averaging 40 each week,
then it does not make sense to encourage employers to hire more
workers for that position.

(1966) (remarks of Sen. Bayh). See also ibid. (remarks of
Sen. Yarborough) (“[T]he salesman . . . [can] sell an
Oldsmobile, a Pontiac, or a Buick all day long and all
night. He is not under any overtime.”). Mechanics’ work
may involve similar “difficult[ies] [in] keeping regular
hours.” Ibid. For example, mechanics may be required to
“answe[r] calls in . . . rural areas,” ibid., or to “go out on
the field where there is a harvesting of sugarbeets,” id., at
20505 (remarks of Sen. Clark).4 And, like salesmen, me­
chanics may be “subject to substantial seasonal variations
in business.” Id., at 20502 (remarks of Sen. Hruska).
    Congress added “partsman” to the exemption because it
believed that job, too, entailed irregular hours. See ibid.
This is “especially true,” several Senators emphasized, “in
the farm equipment business where farmers, during plant­
ing, cultivating and harvesting seasons, may call on their
dealers for parts at any time during the day or evening
and on weekends.” Ibid. (remarks of Sen. Bayh). See also
id., at 20503 (remarks of Sen. Mansfield). In Senator
Bayh’s experience, for instance, a mechanic who “could not
find [a] necessary part” after hours might “call the parts-
man, get him out of bed, and get him to come down to the
store.” Id., at 20504. See also id., at 20503 (remarks of
Sen. Hruska) (“Are we going to say to the farmer who
needs a part . . . on Sunday: You cannot get a spark plug
. . . because the partsman is not exempt, but you can have
machinery repaired by a mechanic who is exempt[?]”).
Although some Senators opposed adding partsmen to the
exemption because, as they understood the job’s demands,
partsmen did not work irregular hours, e.g., id., at 20505
(remarks of Sen. Clark), the crux of the debate under­
scores the exemption’s rationale.
——————
  4 Recall that the exemption extends to salesmen, mechanics, and

partsmen at dealerships selling farm implements and trucks, not just
automobiles. See supra, at 2, n. 1.

   That rationale has no application here. Unlike sales­
men, partsmen, and mechanics, service advisors “wor[k]
ordinary, fixed schedules on-site.” Brief for Respondents
47 (citing Handbook, at 316). Respondents, for instance,
work regular 11-hour shifts, at all times of the year, for a
weekly minimum of 55 hours. See App. 54. Service advi­
sors thus do not implicate the concerns underlying the
§213(b)(10)(A) exemption. Indeed, they are precisely the
type of workers Congress intended the FLSA to shield
“from the evil of overwork,” Barrentine v. Arkansas-Best
Freight System, Inc., </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""110441""><a href=""/opinion/110441/barrentine-v-arkansas-best-freight-system-inc/""><span class=""volume"">450</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">728</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 739 (1981) (internal
quotation marks omitted).
   I note, furthermore, that limiting the exemption to the
three delineated jobs—salesman, partsman, and mechanic—
does not leave the phrase “primarily engaged in selling
or servicing,” §213(b)(10)(A), without utility. Congress
included that language to ensure that only employees who
actually perform the tasks commonly associated with the
enumerated positions would be covered. Otherwise, for
example, a worker who acts as a “salesman” in name only
could lose the FLSA’s protections merely because of the
formal title listed on the employer’s payroll records. See
Bowers v. Fred Haas Toyota World, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">2017</span> <span class=""reporter"">WL</span> <span class=""page"">5127289</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, *4
(SD Tex., June 21, 2017) (“[An employee’s] title alone is
not dispositive of whether he meets the . . . exemption.”).
Thus, by partsmen “primarily engaged in . . . servicing
automobiles,” Congress meant nothing more than parts-
men primarily engaged in the ordinary duties of a parts-
man, i.e., requisitioning, supplying, and repairing parts.
See supra, at 2–3, 4–5. The inclusion of “partsman” there­
fore should not result in the removal of service advisors
from the Act’s protections.
                          III
 Petitioner contends that “affirming the decision below
would disrupt decades of settled expectations” while ex­

posing “employers to substantial retroactive liability.”
Brief for Petitioner 51. “[M]any dealerships,” petitioner
urges, “have offered compensation packages based primar­
ily on sales commissions,” in reliance on court decisions
and agency guidance ranking service advisors as exempt.
Id., at 51–52. Respondents here, for instance, are com­
pensated on a “pure commission basis.” App. 55. Award­
ing retroactive overtime pay to employees who were “fo­
cused on earning commissions,” not “working a set number
of hours,” petitioner argues, would yield an “unjustified
windfal[l].” Brief for Petitioner 53.
   Petitioner’s concerns are doubly overstated. As the
Court previously acknowledged, see Encino Motorcars, 579
U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11), the FLSA provides an affirm­
ative defense that explicitly protects regulated parties
from retroactive liability for actions taken in good-faith
reliance on superseded agency guidance. See </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">29</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">.
§259(a). Given the Department of Labor’s longstanding
view that service advisors fit within the §213(b)(10)(A)
exemption, see ante, at 2, the reliance defense would
surely shield employers from retroactive liability were the
Court to construe the exemption properly.
   Congress, moreover, has spoken directly to the treat­
ment of commission-based workers. The FLSA exempts
from its overtime directives any employee of a “retail or
service establishment” who receives more than half of his
or her pay on commission, so long as the employee’s “regu­
lar rate of pay” is more than 1½ times the minimum wage.
§207(i). Thus, even without the §213(b)(10)(A) exemption,
many service advisors compensated on commission would
remain ineligible for overtime remuneration.5

  5 The current FLSA minimum wage, for example, is $7.25 per hour.

See </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">29</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §206(a)(1)(C). The only commission-based service
advisors at retail or service establishments who are not already exempt

sive working hours,” Barrentine, 450 U. S., at 739.6 By
stretching the §213(b)(10)(A) exemption to encompass
even the lowest income service advisors compensated on
commission, the Court upsets Congress’ careful balance,
while stripping away protection for the most vulnerable
workers in this occupation.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT

    No. 16–1362. Argued January 17, 2018—Decided April 2, 2018
Respondents, current and former service advisors for petitioner Encino
  Motorcars, LLC, sued petitioner for backpay, alleging that petitioner
  violated the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) by failing to pay them
  overtime. Petitioner moved to dismiss, arguing that service advisors
  are exempt from the FLSA’s overtime-pay requirement under 29
  U. S. C. §213(b)(10)(A), which applies to “any salesman, partsman, or
  mechanic primarily engaged in selling or servicing automobiles,
  trucks, or farm implements.” The District Court agreed and dis-
  missed the suit. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.
  It found the statute ambiguous and the legislative history inconclu-
  sive, and it deferred to a 2011 Department of Labor rule that inter-
  preted “salesman” to exclude service advisors. This Court vacated
  the Ninth Circuit’s judgment, holding that courts could not defer to
  the procedurally defective 2011 rule, Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Na-
  varro, 579 U. S. ___, ___–___ (Encino I), but not deciding whether the
  exemption covers service advisors, id., at ___. On remand, the Ninth
  Circuit again held that the exemption does not include service advi-
  sors.
Held: Because service advisors are “salesm[e]n . . . primarily engaged in
 . . . servicing automobiles,” they are exempt from the FLSA’s over-
 time-pay requirement. Pp. 5–11.
     (a) A service advisor is obviously a “salesman.” The ordinary
 meaning of “salesman” is someone who sells goods or services, and
 service advisors “sell [customers] services for their vehicles,” Encino
 I, supra, at ___. P. 6.
     (b) Service advisors are also “primarily engaged in . . . servicing au-
 tomobiles.” “Servicing” can mean either “the action of maintaining or
 repairing a motor vehicle” or “[t]he action of providing a service.” 15
2               ENCINO MOTORCARS, LLC v. NAVARRO

                                  Syllabus

    Oxford English Dictionary 39. Service advisors satisfy both defini-
    tions because they are integral to the servicing process. They “mee[t]
    customers; liste[n] to their concerns about their cars; sugges[t] repair
    and maintenance services; sel[l] new accessories or replacement
    parts; recor[d] service orders; follo[w] up with customers as the ser-
    vices are performed (for instance, if new problems are discovered);
    and explai[n] the repair and maintenance work when customers re-
    turn for their vehicles.” Encino I, supra, at ___. While service advi-
    sors do not spend most of their time physically repairing automobiles,
    neither do partsmen, who the parties agree are “primarily engaged in
    . . . servicing automobiles.” Pp. 6–7.
        (c) The Ninth Circuit invoked the distributive canon—matching
    “salesman” with “selling” and “partsman [and] mechanic” with “[ser-
    vicing]”—to conclude that the exemption simply does not apply to
    “salesm[e]n . . . primarily engaged in . . . servicing automobiles.” But
    the word “or,” which connects all of the exemption’s nouns and ger-
    unds, is “almost always disjunctive.” United States v. Woods, 571
    U. S. 31, 45. Using “or” to join “selling” and “servicing” thus suggests
    that the exemption covers a salesman primarily engaged in either ac-
    tivity.
         Statutory context supports this reading. First, the distributive
    canon has the most force when one-to-one matching is present, but
    here, the statute would require matching some of three nouns with
    one of two gerunds. Second, the distributive canon has the most force
    when an ordinary, disjunctive reading is linguistically impossible.
    But here, “salesman . . . primarily engaged in . . . servicing automo-
    biles” is an apt description of a service advisor. Third, a narrow dis-
    tributive phrasing is an unnatural fit here because the entire exemp-
    tion bespeaks breadth, starting with “any” and using the disjunctive
    “or” three times. Pp. 7–9.
        (d) The Ninth Circuit also invoked the principle that exemptions to
    the FLSA should be construed narrowly. But the Court rejects this
    principle as a guide to interpreting the FLSA. Because the FLSA
    gives no textual indication that its exemptions should be construed
    narrowly, they should be given a fair reading. P. 9.
        (e) Finally, the Ninth Circuit’s reliance on two extraneous sources
    to support its interpretation—the 1966–1967 Occupational Outlook
    Handbook and the FLSA’s legislative history—is unavailing. Pp. 9–
    11.
845 F. 3d 925, reversed and remanded.

 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

                                [April 2, 2018]


  JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.
  The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 52 Stat. 1060, as
amended, 29 U. S. C. §201 et seq., requires employers to
pay overtime compensation to covered employees. The
FLSA exempts from the overtime-pay requirement “any
salesman, partsman, or mechanic primarily engaged in
selling or servicing automobiles” at a covered dealership.
§213(b)(10)(A). We granted certiorari to decide whether
this exemption applies to service advisors—employees at
car dealerships who consult with customers about their
servicing needs and sell them servicing solutions. We
conclude that service advisors are exempt.
                            I

                            A

  Enacted in 1938, the FLSA requires employers to pay
overtime to covered employees who work more than 40
hours in a week. 29 U. S. C. §207(a). But the FLSA ex­
empts many categories of employees from this require­
ment. See §213. Employees at car dealerships have long
been among those exempted.
  Congress initially exempted all employees at car dealer­
2          ENCINO MOTORCARS, LLC v. NAVARRO

                     Opinion of the Court

ships from the overtime-pay requirement. See Fair Labor
Standards Amendments of 1961, §9, 75 Stat. 73. Congress
then narrowed that exemption to cover “any salesman,
partsman, or mechanic primarily engaged in selling or
servicing automobiles, trailers, trucks, farm implements,
or aircraft.” Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1966,
§209, 80 Stat. 836. In 1974, Congress enacted the version
of the exemption at issue here. It provides that the
FLSA’s overtime-pay requirement does not apply to “any
salesman, partsman, or mechanic primarily engaged in
selling or servicing automobiles, trucks, or farm imple­
ments, if he is employed by a nonmanufacturing estab­
lishment primarily engaged in the business of selling such
vehicles or implements to ultimate purchasers.”
§213(b)(10)(A).
   This language has long been understood to cover service
advisors. Although the Department of Labor initially
interpreted it to exclude them, 35 Fed. Reg. 5896 (1970)
(codified at 29 CFR §779.372(c)(4) (1971)), the federal
courts rejected that view, see Brennan v. Deel Motors, Inc.,
475 F. 2d 1095 (CA5 1973); Brennan v. North Bros. Ford,
Inc., 76 CCH LC ¶33, 247 (ED Mich. 1975), aff ’d sub nom.
Dunlop v. North Bros. Ford, Inc., 529 F. 2d 524 (CA6 1976)
(table). After these decisions, the Department issued an
opinion letter in 1978, explaining that service advisors are
exempt in most cases. See Dept. of Labor, Wage & Hour
Div., Opinion Letter No. 1520 (WH–467) (1978), [1978–
1981 Transfer Binder] CCH Wages–Hours Administrative
Rulings ¶31,207. From 1978 to 2011, Congress made no
changes to the exemption, despite amending §213 nearly a
dozen times. The Department also continued to acquiesce
in the view that service advisors are exempt. See Dept. of
Labor, Wage & Hour Div., Field Operations Handbook,
Insert No. 1757, 24L04(k) (Oct. 20, 1987), online at
https://perma.cc/5GHD-KCJJ (as last visited Mar. 28,

                      Opinion of the Court

   In 2011, however, the Department reversed course. It
issued a rule that interpreted “salesman” to exclude ser­
vice advisors. 76 Fed. Reg. 18832, 18859 (2011) (codified
at 29 CFR §779.372(c)). That regulation prompted this
litigation.
                               B
   Petitioner Encino Motorcars, LLC, is a Mercedes-Benz
dealership in California. Respondents are current and
former service advisors for petitioner. Service advisors
“interact with customers and sell them services for their
vehicles.” Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 579 U. S.
___, ___ (2016) (Encino I) (slip op., at 2). They “mee[t]
customers; liste[n] to their concerns about their cars;
sugges[t] repair and maintenance services; sel[l] new
accessories or replacement parts; recor[d] service orders;
follo[w] up with customers as the services are performed
(for instance, if new problems are discovered); and ex­
plai[n] the repair and maintenance work when customers
return for their vehicles.” Ibid.
   In 2012, respondents sued petitioner for backpay. Rely­
ing on the Department’s 2011 regulation, respondents
alleged that petitioner had violated the FLSA by failing to
pay them overtime. Petitioner moved to dismiss, arguing
that service advisors are exempt under §213(b)(10)(A).
The District Court agreed with petitioner and dismissed
the complaint, but the Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit reversed. Finding the text ambiguous and the
legislative history “inconclusive,” the Ninth Circuit de­
ferred to the Department’s 2011 rule under Chevron
U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,
467 U. S. 837 (1984). Encino, 780 F. 3d 1267, 1275 (2015).
   We granted certiorari and vacated the Ninth Circuit’s
judgment. We explained that courts cannot defer to the
2011 rule because it is procedurally defective. See Encino
I, 579 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 8–12). Specifically, the
4           ENCINO MOTORCARS, LLC v. NAVARRO

                      Opinion of the Court

regulation undermined significant reliance interests in the
automobile industry by changing the treatment of service
advisors without a sufficiently reasoned explanation. Id.,
at ___ (slip op., at 10). But we did not decide whether,
without administrative deference, the exemption covers
service advisors. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 12). We remanded
that issue for the Ninth Circuit to address in the first
instance. Ibid.
                               C
  On remand, the Ninth Circuit again held that the ex­
emption does not include service advisors. The Court of
Appeals agreed that a service advisor is a “ ‘salesman’ ” in
a “generic sense,” 845 F. 3d 925, 930 (2017), and is “ ‘pri­
marily engaged in . . . servicing automobiles’ ” in a “general
sense,” id., at 931. Nonetheless, it concluded that “Con­
gress did not intend to exempt service advisors.” Id., at
929.
  The Ninth Circuit began by noting that the Depart­
ment’s 1966–1967 Occupational Outlook Handbook listed
12 job titles in the table of contents that could be found at
a car dealership, including “automobile mechanics,” “au­
tomobile parts countermen,” “automobile salesmen,” and
“automobile service advisors.” Id., at 930. Because the
FLSA exemption listed three of these positions, but not
service advisors, the Ninth Circuit concluded that service
advisors are not exempt. Ibid. The Ninth Circuit also
determined that service advisors are not primarily en­
gaged in “servicing” automobiles, which it defined to mean
“only those who are actually occupied in the repair and
maintenance of cars.” Id., at 931. And the Ninth Circuit
further concluded that the exemption does not cover
salesmen who are primarily engaged in servicing. Id., at
933. In reaching this conclusion, the Ninth Circuit in­
voked the distributive canon. See A. Scalia & B. Garner,
Reading Law 214 (2012) (“Distributive phrasing applies
                 Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)            5

                     Opinion of the Court

each expression to its appropriate referent”). It reasoned
that “Congress intended the gerunds—selling and servic­
ing—to be distributed to their appropriate subjects—
salesman, partsman, and mechanic. A salesman sells; a
partsman services; and a mechanic services.” Id., at 934.
Finally, the Court of Appeals noted that its interpretation
was supported by the principle that exemptions to the
FLSA should be construed narrowly, id., at 935, and the
lack of any “mention of service advisors” in the legislative
history, id., at 939.
  We granted certiorari, 582 U. S. ___ (2017), and now
reverse.
                               II
    The FLSA exempts from its overtime-pay requirement
“any salesman, partsman, or mechanic primarily engaged
in selling or servicing automobiles, trucks, or farm imple­
ments, if he is employed by a nonmanufacturing estab­
lishment primarily engaged in the business of selling such
vehicles or implements to ultimate purchasers.”
§213(b)(10)(A). The parties agree that petitioner is a
“nonmanufacturing establishment primarily engaged in
the business of selling [automobiles] to ultimate purchas­
ers.” The parties also agree that a service advisor is not a
“partsman” or “mechanic,” and that a service advisor is
not “primarily engaged . . . in selling automobiles.” The
question, then, is whether service advisors are “salesm[e]n
. . . primarily engaged in . . . servicing automobiles.” We
conclude that they are. Under the best reading of the text,
service advisors are “salesm[e]n,” and they are “primarily
engaged in . . . servicing automobiles.” The distributive
canon, the practice of construing FLSA exemptions nar­
rowly, and the legislative history do not persuade us
otherwise.
6           ENCINO MOTORCARS, LLC v. NAVARRO

                      Opinion of the Court 


                              A

  A service advisor is obviously a “salesman.” The term
“salesman” is not defined in the statute, so “we give the
term its ordinary meaning.” Taniguchi v. Kan Pacific
Saipan, Ltd., 566 U. S. 560, 566 (2012). The ordinary
meaning of “salesman” is someone who sells goods or
services. See 14 Oxford English Dictionary 391 (2d ed.
1989) (“[a] man whose business it is to sell goods or con­
duct sales”); Random House Dictionary of the English
Language 1262 (1966) (“a man who sells goods, services,
etc.”). Service advisors do precisely that. As this Court
previously explained, service advisors “sell [customers]
services for their vehicles.” Encino I, 579 U. S., at ___ (slip
op., at 2).
                                B
  Service advisors are also “primarily engaged in . . .
servicing automobiles.” §213(b)(10)(A). The word “servic­
ing” in this context can mean either “the action of main­
taining or repairing a motor vehicle” or “[t]he action of
providing a service.” 15 Oxford English Dictionary, at 39;
see also Random House Dictionary of the English Lan­
guage, at 1304 (“to make fit for use; repair; restore to
condition for service”). Service advisors satisfy both defi­
nitions. Service advisors are integral to the servicing
process. They “mee[t] customers; liste[n] to their concerns
about their cars; sugges[t] repair and maintenance ser­
vices; sel[l] new accessories or replacement parts; recor[d]
service orders; follo[w] up with customers as the services
are performed (for instance, if new problems are discov­
ered); and explai[n] the repair and maintenance work
when customers return for their vehicles.” Encino I, su-
pra, at ___ (slip op., at 2). If you ask the average customer
who services his car, the primary, and perhaps only, per­
son he is likely to identify is his service advisor.
  True, service advisors do not spend most of their time
                  Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)              7

                      Opinion of the Court

physically repairing automobiles. But the statutory lan­
guage is not so constrained. All agree that partsmen, for
example, are “primarily engaged in . . . servicing automo­
biles.” Brief for Petitioner 40; Brief for Respondents 41–
44. But partsmen, like service advisors, do not spend most
of their time under the hood. Instead, they “obtain the
vehicle parts . . . and provide those parts to the mechan­
ics.” Encino I, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 2); see also 1 Dept.
of Labor, Dictionary of Occupational Titles 33 (3d ed.
1965) (defining “partsman” as someone who “[p]urchases,
stores, and issues spare parts for automotive and indus­
trial equipment”). In other words, the phrase “primarily
engaged in . . . servicing automobiles” must include some
individuals who do not physically repair automobiles
themselves but who are integrally involved in the servic­
ing process. That description applies to partsmen and
service advisors alike.
                             C
   The Ninth Circuit concluded that service advisors are
not covered because the exemption simply does not apply
to “salesm[e]n . . . primarily engaged in . . . servicing
automobiles.” The Ninth Circuit invoked the distributive
canon to reach this conclusion. Using that canon, it
matched “salesman” with “selling” and “partsma[n] [and]
mechanic” with “servicing.” We reject this reasoning.
   The text of the exemption covers “any salesman, parts-
man, or mechanic primarily engaged in selling or servicing
automobiles, trucks, or farm implements.” §213(b)(10)(A).
The exemption uses the word “or” to connect all of its
nouns and gerunds, and “or” is “almost always disjunc­
tive.” United States v. Woods, 571 U. S. 31, 45 (2013).
Thus, the use of “or” to join “selling” and “servicing” sug­
gests that the exemption covers a salesman primarily
engaged in either activity.
   Unsurprisingly, statutory context can overcome the
8           ENCINO MOTORCARS, LLC v. NAVARRO

                      Opinion of the Court

ordinary, disjunctive meaning of “or.” The distributive
canon, for example, recognizes that sometimes “[w]here a
sentence contains several antecedents and several conse­
quents,” courts should “read them distributively and apply
the words to the subjects which, by context, they seem
most properly to relate.” 2A N. Singer & S. Singer, Suth­
erland Statutes and Statutory Construction §47:26, p. 448
(rev. 7th ed. 2014).
   But here, context favors the ordinary disjunctive mean­
ing of “or” for at least three reasons. First, the distribu­
tive canon has the most force when the statute allows for
one-to-one matching. But here, the distributive canon
would mix and match some of three nouns—“salesman,
partsman, or mechanic”—with one of two gerunds—
“selling or servicing.” §213(b)(10)(A). We doubt that a
legislative drafter would leave it to the reader to figure out
the precise combinations. Second, the distributive canon
has the most force when an ordinary, disjunctive reading
is linguistically impossible. Cf., e.g., Huidekoper’s Lessee
v. Douglass, 3 Cranch 1, 67 (1805) (Marshall, C. J.) (apply­
ing the distributive canon when a purely disjunctive read­
ing “would involve a contradiction in terms”). But as
explained above, the phrase “salesman . . . primarily
engaged in . . . servicing automobiles” not only makes
sense; it is an apt description of a service advisor. Third, a
narrow distributive phrasing is an unnatural fit here
because the entire exemption bespeaks breadth. It begins
with the word “any.” See Ali v. Federal Bureau of Prisons,
552 U. S. 214, 219 (2008) (noting the “expansive meaning”
of “any”). And it uses the disjunctive word “or” three
times. In fact, all agree that the third list in the exemp­
tion—“automobiles, trucks, or farm implements”—
modifies every other noun and gerund. But it would be
odd to read the exemption as starting with a distributive
phrasing and then, halfway through and without warning,
switching to a disjunctive phrasing—all the while using
                  Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)             9

                      Opinion of the Court

the same word (“or”) to signal both meanings. See Brown
v. Gardner, 513 U. S. 115, 118 (1994) (noting the “vigor­
ous” presumption that, “when a term is repeated within a
given sentence,” it “is used to mean the same thing”). The
more natural reading is that the exemption covers any
combination of its nouns, gerunds, and objects.
                                D
    The Ninth Circuit also invoked the principle that ex­
emptions to the FLSA should be construed narrowly. 845
F. 3d, at 935–936. We reject this principle as a useful
guidepost for interpreting the FLSA. Because the FLSA
gives no “textual indication” that its exemptions should be
construed narrowly, “there is no reason to give [them]
anything other than a fair (rather than a ‘narrow’) inter­
pretation.” Scalia, Reading Law, at 363. The narrow-
construction principle relies on the flawed premise that
the FLSA “ ‘pursues’ ” its remedial purpose “ ‘at all costs.’ ”
American Express Co. v. Italian Colors Restaurant, 570
U. S. 228, 234 (2013) (quoting Rodriguez v. United States,
480 U. S. 522, 525–526 (1987) (per curiam)); see also
Henson v. Santander Consumer USA Inc., 582 U. S. ___,
___ (2017) (slip op., at 9) (“[I]t is quite mistaken to assume
. . . that whatever might appear to further the statute’s
primary objective must be the law” (internal quotation
marks and alterations omitted)). But the FLSA has over
two dozen exemptions in §213(b) alone, including the one
at issue here. Those exemptions are as much a part of the
FLSA’s purpose as the overtime-pay requirement. See id.,
at ___ (slip op., at 9) (“Legislation is, after all, the art of
compromise, the limitations expressed in statutory terms
often the price of passage”). We thus have no license to
give the exemption anything but a fair reading.
                          E
  Finally, the Ninth Circuit relied on two extraneous
10          ENCINO MOTORCARS, LLC v. NAVARRO

                      Opinion of the Court

sources to support its interpretation: the Department’s
1966–1967 Occupational Outlook Handbook and the
FLSA’s legislative history. We find neither persuasive.
                             1
   The Ninth Circuit first relied on the Department’s
1966–1967 Occupational Outlook Handbook. It identified
12 jobs from the Handbook’s table of contents that it
thought could be found at automobile dealerships. See
845 F. 3d, at 930. The Ninth Circuit then stressed that
the exemption aligns with three of those job titles—
“[a]utomobile mechanics,” “[a]utomobile parts counter­
men,” and “[a]utomobile salesmen”—but not “[a]utomobile
service advisors.” Ibid.
   The Ninth Circuit cited nothing, however, suggesting
that the exemption was meant to align with the job titles
listed in the Handbook. To the contrary, the exemption
applies to “any salesman . . . primarily engaged in selling
or servicing automobiles.” It is not limited, like the term
in the Handbook, to “automobile salesmen.” And the
ordinary meaning of “salesman” plainly includes service
advisors.
                                2
   The Ninth Circuit also relied on legislative history to
support its interpretation. See id., at 936–939. Specifi-
cally, it noted that the legislative history discusses “automo­
bile salesmen, partsmen, and mechanics” but never dis­
cusses service advisors. Id., at 939. Although the Ninth
Circuit had previously found that same legislative history
“inconclusive,” Encino, 780 F. 3d, at 1275, on remand it
was “firmly persuaded” that the legislative history demon­
strated Congress’ desire to exclude service advisors, 845
F. 3d, at 939.
   The Ninth Circuit was right the first time. As we have
explained, the best reading of the statute is that service
                  Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)                 11

                      Opinion of the Court

advisors are exempt. Even for those Members of this
Court who consider legislative history, silence in the legis­
lative history, “no matter how ‘clanging,’ ” cannot defeat
the better reading of the text and statutory context.
Sedima, S. P. R. L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U. S. 479, 495, n. 13
(1985). If the text is clear, it needs no repetition in the
legislative history; and if the text is ambiguous, silence in
the legislative history cannot lend any clarity. See Avco
Corp. v. Department of Justice, 884 F. 2d 621, 625 (CADC
1989). Even if Congress did not foresee all of the applica­
tions of the statute, that is no reason not to give the statu­
tory text a fair reading. See Union Bank v. Wolas, 502
U. S. 151, 158 (1991).
                         *     *    *
  In sum, we conclude that service advisors are exempt
from the overtime-pay requirement of the FLSA because
they are “salesm[e]n . . . primarily engaged in . . . servicing
automobiles.” §213(b)(10)(A). Accordingly, we reverse the
judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

                                                   It is so ordered.

 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

                        [April 2, 2018]


  JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE BREYER,
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, and JUSTICE KAGAN join, dissenting.
  Diverse categories of employees staff automobile dealer­
ships. Of employees so engaged, Congress explicitly ex­
empted from the Fair Labor Standards Act hours re­
quirements only three occupations: salesmen, partsmen,
and mechanics. The Court today approves the exemption
of a fourth occupation: automobile service advisors. In
accord with the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit, I would not enlarge the exemption to in­
clude service advisors or other occupations outside Con­
gress’ enumeration.
  Respondents are service advisors at a Mercedes-Benz
automobile dealership in the Los Angeles area. They work
regular hours, 7 a.m. to 6 p.m., at least five days per week,
on the dealership premises. App. 54. Their weekly mini­
mum is 55 hours. Maximum hours, for workers covered by
the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA or Act), are 40 per
week. 29 U. S. C. §207(a)(1). In this action, respondents
seek time-and-a-half compensation for hours worked
beyond the 40 per week maximum prescribed by the
FLSA.
  The question presented: Are service advisors exempt
from receipt of overtime compensation under 29 U. S. C.
§213(b)(10)(A)? That exemption covers “any salesman,
2            ENCINO MOTORCARS, LLC v. NAVARRO

                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting

partsman, or mechanic primarily engaged in selling or
servicing automobiles.” Service advisors, such as respond­
ents, neither sell automobiles nor service (i.e., repair or
maintain) vehicles. Rather, they “meet and greet [car]
owners”; “solicit and sugges[t]” repair services “to remedy
the [owner’s] complaints”; “solicit and suggest . . . supple­
mental [vehicle] service[s]”; and provide owners with cost
estimates. App. 55. Because service advisors neither sell
nor repair automobiles, they should remain outside the
exemption and within the Act’s coverage.
                             I
  In 1961, Congress exempted all automobile-dealership
employees from the Act’s overtime-pay requirements. See
Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1961, §9, 75 Stat.
73.1 Five years later, in 1966, Congress confined the
dealership exemption to three categories of employees:
automobile salesmen, mechanics, and partsmen. See Fair
Labor Standards Amendments of 1966, §209, 80 Stat. 836.
At the time, it was well understood that mechanics per­
form “preventive maintenance” and “repairs,” Dept. of
Labor, Occupational Outlook Handbook 477 (1966–1967
ed.) (Handbook), while partsmen requisition parts,
“suppl[y] [them] to mechanics,” id., at 312, and, at times,
have “mechanical responsibilities in repairing parts,” Brief
for International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers, AFL–CIO, as Amicus Curiae 30; see Handbook,
at 312–313 (partsmen may “measure parts for inter­
changeability,” test parts for “defect[s],” and “repair
——————
   1 The exemption further extended to all employees of establishments

selling “trucks” and “farm implements.”        Fair Labor Standards
Amendments of 1961, §9, 75 Stat. 73. When Congress later narrowed
the provision’s scope for automobile-dealership employees, it similarly
diminished the exemption’s application to workers at truck and farm-
implement dealerships. See, e.g., Fair Labor Standards Amendments
of 1966, §209, 80 Stat. 836.

parts”). Congress did not exempt numerous other catego­
ries of dealership employees, among them, automobile
painters, upholsterers, bookkeeping workers, cashiers,
janitors, purchasing agents, shipping and receiving clerks,
and, most relevant here, service advisors. These positions
and their duties were well known at the time, as docu­
mented in U. S. Government catalogs of American jobs.
See Handbook, at XIII, XV, XVI (table of contents); Brief
for International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers, AFL–CIO, as Amicus Curiae 34 (noting “more
than twenty distinct [job] classifications” in the service
department alone).
   “Where Congress explicitly enumerates certain excep­
tions . . . , additional exceptions are not to be implied, in
the absence of evidence of a contrary legislative intent.”
TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U. S. 19, 28 (2001) (internal
quotation marks omitted). The Court thus has no warrant
to add to the three explicitly exempt categories (salesmen,
partsmen, and mechanics) a fourth (service advisors) for
which the Legislature did not provide. The reach of to­
day’s ruling is uncertain, troublingly so: By expansively
reading the exemption to encompass all salesmen, parts-
men, and mechanics who are “integral to the servicing
process,” ante, at 6, the Court risks restoring much of
what Congress intended the 1966 amendment to termi­
nate, i.e., the blanket exemption of all dealership employ­
ees from overtime-pay requirements.
                             II
  Had the §213(b)(10)(A) exemption covered “any sales­
man or mechanic primarily engaged in selling or servicing
automobiles,” there could be no argument that service
advisors fit within it. Only “salesmen” primarily engaged
in “selling” automobiles and “mechanics” primarily en­
gaged in “servicing” them would fall outside the Act’s
coverage. Service advisors, defined as “salesmen primarily
4             ENCINO MOTORCARS, LLC v. NAVARRO

                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting

engaged in the selling of services,” Encino Motorcars, LLC
v. Navarro, 579 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) (THOMAS, J., dissent­
ing) (slip op., at 2) (emphasis added), plainly do not belong
in either category. Moreover, even if the exemption were
read to reach “salesmen” “primarily engaged in servicing
automobiles,” not just selling them, service advisors would
not be exempt. The ordinary meaning of “servicing” is “the
action of maintaining or repairing a motor vehicle.” Ante,
at 6 (quoting 15 Oxford English Dictionary 39 (2d ed.
1989)). As described above, see supra, at 2, service advi­
sors neither maintain nor repair automobiles.2
   Petitioner stakes its case on Congress’ addition of the
“partsman” job to the exemption. See Reply Brief 6–10.
That inclusion, petitioner urges, has a vacuum effect: It
draws into the exemption job categories other than the
three for which Congress provided, in particular, service
advisors. Because partsmen, like service advisors, neither
“sell” nor “service” automobiles in the conventional sense,
petitioner reasons, Congress must have intended the word
“service” to mean something broader than repair and
maintenance.
   To begin with, petitioner’s premise is flawed. Unlike
service advisors, partsmen “ ‘get their hands dirty’ by
‘working as a mechanic’s right-hand man or woman.’ ”

  2 Service advisors do not maintain or repair motor vehicles even if, as

the Court concludes, they are “integral to the servicing process.” Ante,
at 6. The Ninth Circuit provided an apt analogy: “[A] receptionist-
scheduler at a dental office fields calls from patients, matching their
needs (e.g., a broken tooth or jaw pain) with the appropriate provider,
appointment time, and length of anticipated service. That work is
integral to a patient’s obtaining dental services, but we would not say
that the receptionist-scheduler is ‘primarily engaged in’ cleaning teeth
or installing crowns.” 845 F. 3d 925, 932 (2017).

                         GINSBURG, J., dissenting

at 2–3 (describing duties of partsmen). As the Solicitor
General put it last time this case was before the Court, a
mechanic “might be able to obtain the parts to complete a
repair without the real-time assistance of a partsman by
his side.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in No.
15–415, p. 23. But dividing the “key [repair] tasks . . .
between two individuals” only “reinforces” “that both the
mechanic and the partsman are . . . involved in repairing
(‘servicing’) the vehicle.” Ibid. Service advisors, in con­
trast, “sell . . . services [to customers] for their vehicles,”
Encino Motorcars, 579 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2) (empha­
sis added)—services that are later performed by mechan­
ics and partsmen.
   Adding partsmen to the exemption, moreover, would be
an exceptionally odd way for Congress to have indicated
that “servicing” should be given a meaning deviating from
its ordinary usage. There is a more straightforward ex­
planation for Congress’ inclusion of partsmen alongside
salesmen and mechanics: Common features of the three
enumerated jobs make them unsuitable for overtime pay.
   Both salesmen and mechanics work irregular hours,
including nights and weekends, not uncommonly offsite,
rendering time worked not easily tracked.3 As noted in
the 1966 Senate floor debate, salesmen “go out at unusual
hours, trying to earn commissions.” 112 Cong. Rec. 20504
——————
   3 In addition to practical difficulties in calculating hours, a core pur­

pose of overtime may not be served when employees’ hours regularly
fluctuate. Enacted in the midst of the Great Depression, the FLSA
overtime rules encourage employers to hire more individuals who work
40-hour weeks, rather than maintaining a staff of fewer employees who
consistently work longer hours. See Overnight Motor Transp. Co. v.
Missel, 316 U. S. 572, 577–578 (1942) (overtime rules apply “financial
pressure” on employers to “spread employment”); 7 D. VanDeusen,
Labor and Employment Law §176.02[1] (2018). But if a position’s
working hours routinely ebb and flow, while averaging 40 each week,
then it does not make sense to encourage employers to hire more
workers for that position.

(1966) (remarks of Sen. Bayh). See also ibid. (remarks of
Sen. Yarborough) (“[T]he salesman . . . [can] sell an
Oldsmobile, a Pontiac, or a Buick all day long and all
night. He is not under any overtime.”). Mechanics’ work
may involve similar “difficult[ies] [in] keeping regular
hours.” Ibid. For example, mechanics may be required to
“answe[r] calls in . . . rural areas,” ibid., or to “go out on
the field where there is a harvesting of sugarbeets,” id., at
20505 (remarks of Sen. Clark).4 And, like salesmen, me­
chanics may be “subject to substantial seasonal variations
in business.” Id., at 20502 (remarks of Sen. Hruska).
    Congress added “partsman” to the exemption because it
believed that job, too, entailed irregular hours. See ibid.
This is “especially true,” several Senators emphasized, “in
the farm equipment business where farmers, during plant­
ing, cultivating and harvesting seasons, may call on their
dealers for parts at any time during the day or evening
and on weekends.” Ibid. (remarks of Sen. Bayh). See also
id., at 20503 (remarks of Sen. Mansfield). In Senator
Bayh’s experience, for instance, a mechanic who “could not
find [a] necessary part” after hours might “call the parts-
man, get him out of bed, and get him to come down to the
store.” Id., at 20504. See also id., at 20503 (remarks of
Sen. Hruska) (“Are we going to say to the farmer who
needs a part . . . on Sunday: You cannot get a spark plug
. . . because the partsman is not exempt, but you can have
machinery repaired by a mechanic who is exempt[?]”).
Although some Senators opposed adding partsmen to the
exemption because, as they understood the job’s demands,
partsmen did not work irregular hours, e.g., id., at 20505
(remarks of Sen. Clark), the crux of the debate under­
scores the exemption’s rationale.
——————
  4 Recall that the exemption extends to salesmen, mechanics, and

partsmen at dealerships selling farm implements and trucks, not just
automobiles. See supra, at 2, n. 1.

                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting

   That rationale has no application here. Unlike sales­
men, partsmen, and mechanics, service advisors “wor[k]
ordinary, fixed schedules on-site.” Brief for Respondents
47 (citing Handbook, at 316). Respondents, for instance,
work regular 11-hour shifts, at all times of the year, for a
weekly minimum of 55 hours. See App. 54. Service advi­
sors thus do not implicate the concerns underlying the
§213(b)(10)(A) exemption. Indeed, they are precisely the
type of workers Congress intended the FLSA to shield
“from the evil of overwork,” Barrentine v. Arkansas-Best
Freight System, Inc., 450 U. S. 728, 739 (1981) (internal
quotation marks omitted).
   I note, furthermore, that limiting the exemption to the
three delineated jobs—salesman, partsman, and mechanic—
does not leave the phrase “primarily engaged in selling
or servicing,” §213(b)(10)(A), without utility. Congress
included that language to ensure that only employees who
actually perform the tasks commonly associated with the
enumerated positions would be covered. Otherwise, for
example, a worker who acts as a “salesman” in name only
could lose the FLSA’s protections merely because of the
formal title listed on the employer’s payroll records. See
Bowers v. Fred Haas Toyota World, 2017 WL 5127289, *4
(SD Tex., June 21, 2017) (“[An employee’s] title alone is
not dispositive of whether he meets the . . . exemption.”).
Thus, by partsmen “primarily engaged in . . . servicing
automobiles,” Congress meant nothing more than parts-
men primarily engaged in the ordinary duties of a parts-
man, i.e., requisitioning, supplying, and repairing parts.
See supra, at 2–3, 4–5. The inclusion of “partsman” there­
fore should not result in the removal of service advisors
from the Act’s protections.
                          III
 Petitioner contends that “affirming the decision below
would disrupt decades of settled expectations” while ex­
8            ENCINO MOTORCARS, LLC v. NAVARRO

posing “employers to substantial retroactive liability.”
Brief for Petitioner 51. “[M]any dealerships,” petitioner
urges, “have offered compensation packages based primar­
ily on sales commissions,” in reliance on court decisions
and agency guidance ranking service advisors as exempt.
Id., at 51–52. Respondents here, for instance, are com­
pensated on a “pure commission basis.” App. 55. Award­
ing retroactive overtime pay to employees who were “fo­
cused on earning commissions,” not “working a set number
of hours,” petitioner argues, would yield an “unjustified
windfal[l].” Brief for Petitioner 53.
   Petitioner’s concerns are doubly overstated. As the
Court previously acknowledged, see Encino Motorcars, 579
U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11), the FLSA provides an affirm­
ative defense that explicitly protects regulated parties
from retroactive liability for actions taken in good-faith
reliance on superseded agency guidance. See 29 U. S. C.
§259(a). Given the Department of Labor’s longstanding
view that service advisors fit within the §213(b)(10)(A)
exemption, see ante, at 2, the reliance defense would
surely shield employers from retroactive liability were the
Court to construe the exemption properly.
   Congress, moreover, has spoken directly to the treat­
ment of commission-based workers. The FLSA exempts
from its overtime directives any employee of a “retail or
service establishment” who receives more than half of his
or her pay on commission, so long as the employee’s “regu­
lar rate of pay” is more than 1½ times the minimum wage.
§207(i). Thus, even without the §213(b)(10)(A) exemption,
many service advisors compensated on commission would
remain ineligible for overtime remuneration.5
——————
  5 The current FLSA minimum wage, for example, is $7.25 per hour.

See 29 U. S. C. §206(a)(1)(C). The only commission-based service
advisors at retail or service establishments who are not already exempt
under §207(i)—and who thus remain eligible for overtime—are those
earning less than $10.88 per hour. Providing such workers time-and-a­

  In crafting the commission-pay exemption, Congress
struck a deliberate balance: It exempted higher paid com­
missioned employees, perhaps in recognition of their
potentially irregular hours, see Mechmet v. Four Seasons
Hotels, Ltd., 825 F. 2d 1173, 1176–1177 (CA7 1987); cf.
supra, at 5–7, but it maintained protection for lower paid
employees, to vindicate the Act’s “principal . . . purpose” of
shielding “workers from substandard wages and oppres­
sive working hours,” Barrentine, 450 U. S., at 739.6 By
stretching the §213(b)(10)(A) exemption to encompass
even the lowest income service advisors compensated on
commission, the Court upsets Congress’ careful balance,
while stripping away protection for the most vulnerable
workers in this occupation.

  This Court once recognized that the “particularity” of
FLSA exemptions “preclude[s] their enlargement by impli­
cation.” Addison v. Holly Hill Fruit Products, Inc., 322
U. S. 607, 617 (1944). Employees outside the Act’s “nar­
row and specific” exemptions, the Court affirmed, “remain
within the Act.” Powell v. United States Cartridge Co.,
339 U. S. 497, 517 (1950).7 The Court today, in adding an
——————
half pay, as Congress directed, would confer, at most, $5.44 per over­
time hour.
    6 Congress struck a similar balance in 29 U. S. C. §207(f), which ex­

empts employees whose duties “necessitate irregular hours of work,”
but only if they receive specified minimum rates of pay.
    7 This Court has long held that FLSA “exemptions are to be narrowly

construed against the employers seeking to assert them and their
application limited to those [cases] plainly and unmistakably within
their terms and spirit.” Arnold v. Ben Kanowsky, Inc., 361 U. S. 388,
392 (1960). This principle is a well-grounded application of the general
rule that an “exception to a general statement of policy is usually read
. . . narrowly in order to preserve the primary operation of the provi­
sion.” Maracich v. Spears, 570 U. S. 48, 60 (2013) (internal quotation
marks omitted). In a single paragraph, the Court “reject[s]” this
longstanding principle as applied to the FLSA, ante, at 9, without even

exemption of its own creation, veers away from that com­
prehension of the FLSA’s mission. I would instead resist,
as the Ninth Circuit did, diminishment of the Act’s over­
time strictures.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
          ANDREW KISELA v. AMY HUGHES
   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED 

    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

               No. 17–467.    Decided April 2, 2018


  PER CURIAM.
  Petitioner Andrew Kisela, a police officer in Tucson,
Arizona, shot respondent Amy Hughes. Kisela and two
other officers had arrived on the scene after hearing a
police radio report that a woman was engaging in erratic
behavior with a knife. They had been there but a few
minutes, perhaps just a minute. When Kisela fired,
Hughes was holding a large kitchen knife, had taken steps
toward another woman standing nearby, and had refused
to drop the knife after at least two commands to do so.
The question is whether at the time of the shooting
Kisela’s actions violated clearly established law.
  The record, viewed in the light most favorable to
Hughes, shows the following. In May 2010, somebody in
Hughes’ neighborhood called 911 to report that a woman
was hacking a tree with a kitchen knife. Kisela and an-
other police officer, Alex Garcia, heard about the report
over the radio in their patrol car and responded. A few
minutes later the person who had called 911 flagged down
the officers; gave them a description of the woman with
the knife; and told them the woman had been acting errat-
ically. About the same time, a third police officer, Lindsay
Kunz, arrived on her bicycle.
  Garcia spotted a woman, later identified as Sharon
Chadwick, standing next to a car in the driveway of a
nearby house. A chain-link fence with a locked gate sepa-
rated Chadwick from the officers. The officers then saw
another woman, Hughes, emerge from the house carrying
a large knife at her side. Hughes matched the description
2                     KISELA v. HUGHES

                          Per Curiam

of the woman who had been seen hacking a tree. Hughes
walked toward Chadwick and stopped no more than six
feet from her.
   All three officers drew their guns. At least twice they
told Hughes to drop the knife. Viewing the record in the
light most favorable to Hughes, Chadwick said “take it
easy” to both Hughes and the officers. Hughes appeared
calm, but she did not acknowledge the officers’ presence or
drop the knife. The top bar of the chain-link fence blocked
Kisela’s line of fire, so he dropped to the ground and shot
Hughes four times through the fence. Then the officers
jumped the fence, handcuffed Hughes, and called para-
medics, who transported her to a hospital. There she was
treated for non-life-threatening injuries. Less than a
minute had transpired from the moment the officers saw
Chadwick to the moment Kisela fired shots.
   All three of the officers later said that at the time of the
shooting they subjectively believed Hughes to be a threat
to Chadwick. After the shooting, the officers discovered
that Chadwick and Hughes were roommates, that Hughes
had a history of mental illness, and that Hughes had been
upset with Chadwick over a $20 debt. In an affidavit
produced during discovery, Chadwick said that a few
minutes before the shooting her boyfriend had told her
Hughes was threatening to kill Chadwick’s dog, named
Bunny. Chadwick “came home to find” Hughes “somewhat
distressed,” and Hughes was in the house holding Bunny
“in one hand and a kitchen knife in the other.” Hughes
asked Chadwick if she “wanted [her] to use the knife on
the dog.” The officers knew none of this, though. Chad-
wick went outside to get $20 from her car, which is when
the officers first saw her. In her affidavit Chadwick said
that she did not feel endangered at any time. Ibid. Based
on her experience as Hughes’ roommate, Chadwick stated
that Hughes “occasionally has episodes in which she acts
inappropriately,” but “she is only seeking attention.” 2

Record 108.
   Hughes sued Kisela under Rev. Stat. §1979, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">42</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">.
§1983, alleging that Kisela had used excessive force in
violation of the Fourth Amendment. The District Court
granted summary judgment to Kisela, but the Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">862</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.3d</span> <span class=""page"">775</span></span><pre class=""inline"">
(2016).
   The Court of Appeals first held that the record, viewed
in the light most favorable to Hughes, was sufficient to
demonstrate that Kisela violated the Fourth Amendment.
See id., at 782. The court next held that the violation was
clearly established because, in its view, the constitutional
violation was obvious and because of Circuit precedent
that the court perceived to be analogous. Id., at 785.
Kisela filed a petition for rehearing en banc. Over the
dissent of seven judges, the Court of Appeals denied it.
Kisela then filed a petition for certiorari in this Court.
That petition is now granted.
   In one of the first cases on this general subject, Tennes-
see v. Garner, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""111397""><a href=""/opinion/111397/tennessee-v-garner/""><span class=""volume"">471</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">1</span></a></span><pre class=""inline""> (1985), the Court addressed the
constitutionality of the police using force that can be deadly.
There, the Court held that “[w]here the officer has proba-
ble cause to believe that the suspect poses a threat of
serious physical harm, either to the officer or to others, it
is not constitutionally unreasonable to prevent escape by
using deadly force.” Id., at 11.
   In Graham v. Connor, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""112257""><a href=""/opinion/112257/graham-v-connor/""><span class=""volume"">490</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">386</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 396 (1989), the
Court held that the question whether an officer has used
excessive force “requires careful attention to the facts and
circumstances of each particular case, including the sever-
ity of the crime at issue, whether the suspect poses an
immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others,
and whether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting
to evade arrest by flight.” “The ‘reasonableness’ of a par-
ticular use of force must be judged from the perspective of
a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the
4                    KISELA v. HUGHES

                         Per Curiam

20/20 vision of hindsight.” Ibid. And “[t]he calculus of
reasonableness must embody allowance for the fact that
police officers are often forced to make split-second judg-
ments—in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and
rapidly evolving—about the amount of force that is neces-
sary in a particular situation.” Id., at 396–397.
    Here, the Court need not, and does not, decide whether
Kisela violated the Fourth Amendment when he used
deadly force against Hughes. For even assuming a Fourth
Amendment violation occurred—a proposition that is not
at all evident—on these facts Kisela was at least entitled
to qualified immunity.
    “Qualified immunity attaches when an official’s conduct
does not violate clearly established statutory or constitu-
tional rights of which a reasonable person would have
known.” White v. Pauly, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">580</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">___, ___ (2017) (per
curiam) (slip op., at 6) (alterations and internal quotation
marks omitted). “Because the focus is on whether the
officer had fair notice that her conduct was unlawful,
reasonableness is judged against the backdrop of the law
at the time of the conduct.” Brosseau v. Haugen, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""137736""><a href=""/opinion/137736/brosseau-v-haugen/""><span class=""volume"">543</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span>
<span class=""page"">194</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 198 (2004) (per curiam).
    Although “this Court’s caselaw does not require a case
directly on point for a right to be clearly established,
existing precedent must have placed the statutory or
constitutional question beyond debate.” White, 580 U. S.,
at ___ (slip op., at 6) (internal quotation marks omitted).
“In other words, immunity protects all but the plainly
incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.”
Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). This Court has

lar—not to define clearly established law at a high level of
generality.’ ”   City and County of San Francisco v.

   “[S]pecificity is especially important in the Fourth
Amendment context, where the Court has recognized that
it is sometimes difficult for an officer to determine how the
relevant legal doctrine, here excessive force, will apply to
the factual situation the officer confronts.” Mullenix v.
Luna, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">577</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">___, ___ (2015) (per curiam) (slip op., at 5)
(internal quotation marks omitted). Use of excessive force
is an area of the law “in which the result depends very
much on the facts of each case,” and thus police officers
are entitled to qualified immunity unless existing prece-
dent “squarely governs” the specific facts at issue. Id., at
___ (slip op., at 6) (internal quotation marks omitted and
emphasis deleted). Precedent involving similar facts can
help move a case beyond the otherwise “hazy border be-
tween excessive and acceptable force” and thereby provide
an officer notice that a specific use of force is unlaw-
ful. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (internal quotation marks
omitted).
   “Of course, general statements of the law are not inher-
ently incapable of giving fair and clear warning to offic-
ers.” White, 580 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7) (internal
quotation marks omitted). But the general rules set forth
in “Garner and Graham do not by themselves create clearly
established law outside an ‘obvious case.’ ” Ibid. Where
constitutional guidelines seem inapplicable or too remote,
it does not suffice for a court simply to state that an officer
may not use unreasonable and excessive force, deny quali-
fied immunity, and then remit the case for a trial on the
question of reasonableness. An officer “cannot be said to
have violated a clearly established right unless the right’s
contours were sufficiently definite that any reasonable
official in the defendant’s shoes would have understood
that he was violating it.” Plumhoff v. Rickard, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">572</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span>
<span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 12). That is a necessary part of
the qualified-immunity standard, and it is a part of the
standard that the Court of Appeals here failed to imple-
6                    KISELA v. HUGHES

                         Per Curiam

ment in a correct way.
   Kisela says he shot Hughes because, although the offic-
ers themselves were in no apparent danger, he believed
she was a threat to Chadwick. Kisela had mere seconds to
assess the potential danger to Chadwick. He was con-
fronted with a woman who had just been seen hacking a
tree with a large kitchen knife and whose behavior was
erratic enough to cause a concerned bystander to call 911
and then flag down Kisela and Garcia. Kisela was sepa-
rated from Hughes and Chadwick by a chain-link fence;
Hughes had moved to within a few feet of Chadwick; and
she failed to acknowledge at least two commands to drop
the knife. Those commands were loud enough that Chad-
wick, who was standing next to Hughes, heard them. This
is far from an obvious case in which any competent officer
would have known that shooting Hughes to protect Chad-
wick would violate the Fourth Amendment.
   The Court of Appeals made additional errors in conclud-
ing that its own precedent clearly established that Kisela
used excessive force. To begin with, “even if a controlling
circuit precedent could constitute clearly established law
in these circumstances, it does not do so here.” Sheehan,
supra, at ___ (slip op., at 13). In fact, the most analogous
Circuit precedent favors Kisela. See Blanford v. Sacra-
mento County, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""790155""><a href=""/opinion/790155/matthew-aaron-blanford-v-sacramento-county-lou-blanas-sacramento-county/""><span class=""volume"">406</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.3d</span> <span class=""page"">1110</span></a></span><pre class=""inline""> (CA9 2005). In Blanford,
the police responded to a report that a man was walking
through a residential neighborhood carrying a sword and
acting in an erratic manner. Id., at 1112. There, as here,
the police shot the man after he refused their commands
to drop his weapon (there, as here, the man might not
have heard the commands). Id., at 1113. There, as here,
the police believed (perhaps mistakenly), that the man
posed an immediate threat to others. Ibid. There, the
Court of Appeals determined that the use of deadly force
did not violate the Fourth Amendment. Id., at 1119.
Based on that decision, a reasonable officer could have
                 Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)            7

                          Per Curiam

believed the same thing was true in the instant case.
  In contrast, not one of the decisions relied on by the
Court of Appeals—Deorle v. Rutherford, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""775749""><a href=""/opinion/775749/richard-leo-deorle-v-greg-rutherford-butte-county-deputy-sheriff-mick/""><span class=""volume"">272</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.3d</span> <span class=""page"">1272</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">

1997)—supports denying Kisela qualified immunity. As
for Deorle, this Court has already instructed the Court of
Appeals not to read its decision in that case too broadly in
deciding whether a new set of facts is governed by clearly
established law. Sheehan, 572 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op.,
at 13–14). Deorle involved a police officer who shot an
unarmed man in the face, without warning, even though
the officer had a clear line of retreat; there were no by-
standers nearby; the man had been “physically compliant
and generally followed all the officers’ instructions”; and
he had been under police observation for roughly 40
minutes. </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">272</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.</span> <span class=""page"">3d</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, at 1276, 1281–1282. In this case,
by contrast, Hughes was armed with a large knife; was
within striking distance of Chadwick; ignored the officers’
orders to drop the weapon; and the situation unfolded in
less than a minute. “Whatever the merits of the decision
in Deorle, the differences between that case and the case
before us leap from the page.” Sheehan, supra, at ___ (slip
op., at 14).
  Glenn, which the panel described as “[t]he most analo-
gous Ninth Circuit case,” </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">862</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.</span> <span class=""page"">3d</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, at 783, was decided
after the shooting at issue here. Thus, Glenn “could not
have given fair notice to [Kisela]” because a reasonable
officer is not required to foresee judicial decisions that do
not yet exist in instances where the requirements of the
Fourth Amendment are far from obvious. Brosseau, 543
U. S., at 200, n. 4. Glenn was therefore “of no use in the
clearly established inquiry.” Brosseau, supra, at 200, n. 4.
Other judges brought this mistaken or misleading citation
to the panel’s attention while Kisela’s petition for rehear-
ing en banc was pending before the Court of Appeals. 862
8                     KISELA v. HUGHES

                          Per Curiam

F.3d, at 795, n. 2 (Ikuta, J., dissenting from denial of
rehearing en banc). The panel then amended its opinion,
but nevertheless still attempted to “rely on Glenn as illus-
trative, not as indicative of the clearly established law in
2010.” Id., at 784, n. 2 (majority opinion). The panel
failed to explain the difference between “illustrative” and
“indicative” precedent, and none is apparent.
   The amended opinion also asserted, for the first time
and without explanation, that the Court of Appeals’ deci-
sion in Harris clearly established that the shooting here
was unconstitutional. Id., at 785. The new mention of
Harris replaced a reference in the panel’s first opinion to
Glenn—the case that postdated the shooting at issue here.

In Harris, the Court of Appeals determined that an FBI
sniper, who was positioned safely on a hilltop, used exces-
sive force when he shot a man in the back while the man
was retreating to a cabin during what has been referred to
as the Ruby Ridge standoff. </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">126</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.</span> <span class=""page"">3d</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, at 1202–1203.
Suffice it to say, a reasonable police officer could miss the
connection between the situation confronting the sniper at
Ruby Ridge and the situation confronting Kisela in
Hughes’ front yard.
   For these reasons, the petition for certiorari is granted;
the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed; and the
case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion.
                                              It is so ordered.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
          ANDREW KISELA v. AMY HUGHES
   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED 

    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

              No. 17–467.   Decided April 2, 2018


   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG
joins, dissenting.
   Officer Andrew Kisela shot Amy Hughes while she was
speaking with her roommate, Sharon Chadwick, outside of
their home. The record, properly construed at this stage,
shows that at the time of the shooting: Hughes stood
stationary about six feet away from Chadwick, appeared
“composed and content,” Appellant’s Excerpts of Record
109 (Record), and held a kitchen knife down at her side
with the blade facing away from Chadwick. Hughes was
nowhere near the officers, had committed no illegal act,
was suspected of no crime, and did not raise the knife in
the direction of Chadwick or anyone else. Faced with
these facts, the two other responding officers held their
fire, and one testified that he “wanted to continue trying
verbal command[s] and see if that would work.” Id., at
120. But not Kisela. He thought it necessary to use deadly
force, and so, without giving a warning that he would
open fire, he shot Hughes four times, leaving her seriously
injured.
   If this account of Kisela’s conduct sounds unreasonable,
that is because it was. And yet, the Court today insulates
that conduct from liability under the doctrine of qualified
immunity, holding that Kisela violated no “clearly estab­
lished” law. See ante, at 5–6. I disagree. Viewing the
facts in the light most favorable to Hughes, as the Court
must at summary judgment, a jury could find that Kisela
violated Hughes’ clearly established Fourth Amendment
rights by needlessly resorting to lethal force. In holding
2                     KISELA v. HUGHES

                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

otherwise, the Court misapprehends the facts and misap­
plies the law, effectively treating qualified immunity as an
absolute shield. I therefore respectfully dissent.
                               I
   This case arrives at our doorstep on summary judgment,
so we must “view the evidence . . . in the light most favor­
able to” Hughes, the nonmovant, “with respect to the
central facts of this case.” Tolan v. Cotton, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">572</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">___,
___ (2014) (per curiam) (slip op., at 8). The majority pur­
ports to honor this well-settled principle, but its efforts fall
short. Although the majority sets forth most of the rele­
vant events that transpired, it conspicuously omits several
critical facts and draws premature inferences that bear on
the qualified-immunity inquiry. Those errors are fatal to
its analysis, because properly construing all of the facts in
the light most favorable to Hughes, and drawing all infer­
ences in her favor, a jury could find that the following
events occurred on the day of Hughes’ encounter with the
Tucson police.
   On May 21, 2010, Kisela and Officer-in-Training Alex
Garcia received a “ ‘check welfare’ ” call about a woman
chopping away at a tree with a knife. </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">862</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.3d</span> <span class=""page"">775</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 778
(CA9 2016). They responded to the scene, where they
were informed by the person who had placed the call (not
Chadwick) that the woman with the knife had been acting
“erratically.” Ibid. A third officer, Lindsay Kunz, later
joined the scene. The officers observed Hughes, who
matched the description given to the officers of the woman
alleged to have been cutting the tree, emerge from a house
with a kitchen knife in her hand. Hughes exited the front
door and approached Chadwick, who was standing outside
in the driveway.
   Hughes then stopped about six feet from Chadwick,

conversed with one another; Hughes appeared “composed
and content,” Record 109, and did not look angry. See </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">862</span>
<span class=""reporter"">F.</span> <span class=""page"">3d</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, at 778. At no point during this exchange did
Hughes raise the kitchen knife or verbally threaten to
harm Chadwick or the officers. Chadwick later averred
that, during the incident, she was never in fear of Hughes
and “was not the least bit threatened by the fact that
[Hughes] had a knife in her hand” and that Hughes “never
acted in a threatening manner.” Record 110–111. The
officers did not observe Hughes commit any crime, nor was
Hughes suspected of committing one. See </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">862</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.</span> <span class=""page"">3d</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, at
780.
   Nevertheless, the officers hastily drew their guns and
ordered Hughes to drop the knife. The officers gave that
order twice, but the commands came “in quick succession.”
Id., at 778. The evidence in the record suggests that
Hughes may not have heard or understood the officers’
commands and may not have been aware of the officers’
presence at all. Record 109–110, 195, 323–324 (Officer
Kunz’s testimony that “it seemed as though [Hughes]
didn’t even know we were there,” and “[i]t was like she
didn’t hear us almost”); id., at 304 (Officer Garcia’s testi­
mony that Hughes acted “almost as if we weren’t there”).
Although the officers were in uniform, they never verbally
identified themselves as law enforcement officers.
   Kisela did not wait for Hughes to register, much less
respond to, the officers’ rushed commands. Instead, Kisela
immediately and unilaterally escalated the situation.
Without giving any advance warning that he would shoot,
and without attempting less dangerous methods to deesca­
late the situation, he dropped to the ground and shot four
times at Hughes (who was stationary) through a chain-
link fence. After being shot, Hughes fell to the ground,
screaming and bleeding from her wounds. She looked at
the officers and asked, “ ‘Why’d you shoot me?’ ” Id., at
308. Hughes was immediately transported to the hospital,

where she required treatment for her injuries. Kisela
alone resorted to deadly force in this case. Confronted
with the same circumstances as Kisela, neither of his
fellow officers took that drastic measure.

   Police officers are not entitled to qualified immunity if
“(1) they violated a federal statutory or constitutional
right, and (2) the unlawfulness of their conduct was ‘clearly
established at the time.’ ” District of Columbia v. Wesby,
</pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">583</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 13) (quoting Reichle v.

that well-settled standard, the Ninth Circuit held that a
jury could find that Kisela violated Hughes’ clearly estab­
lished Fourth Amendment rights. That conclusion was
correct.
                               A
   I begin with the first step of the qualified-immunity
inquiry: whether there was a violation of a constitutional
right. Hughes alleges that Kisela violated her Fourth
Amendment rights by deploying excessive force against
her. In assessing such a claim, courts must ask “whether
the officers’ actions are ‘objectively reasonable’ in light of
the facts and circumstances confronting them.” Graham
v. Connor, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""112257""><a href=""/opinion/112257/graham-v-connor/""><span class=""volume"">490</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">386</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 397 (1989). That inquiry “re­
quires careful attention to the facts and circumstances of
each particular case, including the severity of the crime at
issue, whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to
the safety of the officers or others, and whether he is
actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by
flight.” Id., at 396; see also Tennessee v. Garner, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""111397""><a href=""/opinion/111397/tennessee-v-garner/""><span class=""volume"">471</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span>
<span class=""page"">1</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 11 (1985). All of those factors (and others) support the
Ninth Circuit’s conclusion that a jury could find that
Kisela’s use of deadly force was objectively unreasonable.
</pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">862</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.</span> <span class=""page"">3d</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, at 779–782. Indeed, the panel’s resolution of

                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

this question was so convincing that not a single judge on
the Ninth Circuit, including the seven who dissented from
denial of rehearing en banc, expressly disputed that con­
clusion. See id., at 791–799 (opinion of Ikuta, J.). Neither
does the majority here, which simply assumes without
deciding that “a Fourth Amendment violation occurred.”
Ante, at 4.
   First, Hughes committed no crime and was not suspected
of committing a crime. The officers were responding to a
“check welfare” call, which reported no criminal activity,
and the officers did not observe any illegal activity while
at the scene. The mere fact that Hughes held a kitchen
knife down at her side with the blade pointed away from
Chadwick hardly elevates the situation to one that justi­
fies deadly force.
   Second, a jury could reasonably conclude that Hughes
presented no immediate or objective threat to Chadwick or
the other officers. It is true that Kisela had received a
report that a woman matching Hughes’ description had
been acting erratically. But the police officers themselves
never witnessed any erratic conduct. Instead, when
viewed in the light most favorable to Hughes, the record
evidence of what the police encountered paints a calmer
picture. It shows that Hughes was several feet from
Chadwick and even farther from the officers, she never
made any aggressive or threatening movements, and she
appeared “composed and content” during the brief
encounter.
   Third, Hughes did not resist or evade arrest. Based on
this record, there is significant doubt as to whether she
was aware of the officers’ presence at all, and evidence
suggests that Hughes did not hear the officers’ swift com­
mands to drop the knife.
   Finally, the record suggests that Kisela could have, but
failed to, use less intrusive means before deploying deadly
force. </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">862</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.</span> <span class=""page"">3d</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, at 781. For instance, Hughes submitted
6                    KISELA v. HUGHES

                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

expert testimony concluding that Kisela should have used
his Taser and that shooting his gun through the fence was
dangerous because a bullet could have fragmented against
the fence and hit Chadwick or his fellow officers. Ibid.; see
also Bryan v. MacPherson, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""180078""><a href=""/opinion/180078/bryan-v-macpherson/""><span class=""volume"">630</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.3d</span> <span class=""page"">805</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 831 (CA9 2010)
(noting that “police are required to consider what other
tactics if any were available to effect the arrest” and
whether there are “clear, reasonable, and less intrusive
alternatives” (internal quotation marks and alteration
omitted)). Consistent with that assessment, the other two
officers on the scene declined to fire at Hughes, and one of
them explained that he was inclined to use “some of the
lesser means” than shooting, including verbal commands,
because he believed there was time “[t]o try to talk
[Hughes] down.” Record 120–121. That two officers on
the scene, presented with the same circumstances as
Kisela, did not use deadly force reveals just how unneces­
sary and unreasonable it was for Kisela to fire four shots
at Hughes. See Plumhoff v. Rickard, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">572</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">___, ___
(2014) (slip op., at 8) (“We analyze [the objective reason-
ableness] question from the perspective of a reasonable
officer on the scene” (internal quotation marks omitted)).
  Taken together, the foregoing facts would permit a jury
to conclude that Kisela acted outside the bounds of the
Fourth Amendment by shooting Hughes four times.
                               B
  Rather than defend the reasonableness of Kisela’s con­
duct, the majority sidesteps the inquiry altogether and
focuses instead on the “clearly established” prong of the
qualified-immunity analysis. Ante, at 4. To be “ ‘clearly
established’ . . . [t]he contours of the right must be suffi­
ciently clear that a reasonable official would understand
that what he is doing violates that right.” Anderson v.
Creighton, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""111953""><a href=""/opinion/111953/anderson-v-creighton/""><span class=""volume"">483</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">635</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 640 (1987). That standard is not
nearly as onerous as the majority makes it out to be. As

                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

even the majority must acknowledge, ante, at 4, this Court
has long rejected the notion that “an official action is
protected by qualified immunity unless the very action in
question has previously been held unlawful,” Anderson,
483 U. S., at 640. “[O]fficials can still be on notice that
their conduct violates established law even in novel factual
circumstances.” Hope v. Pelzer, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""121169""><a href=""/opinion/121169/hope-v-pelzer/""><span class=""volume"">536</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">730</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 741 (2002).
At its core, then, the “clearly established” inquiry boils
down to whether Kisela had “fair notice” that he acted
unconstitutionally. See ibid.; Brosseau v. Haugen, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""137736""><a href=""/opinion/137736/brosseau-v-haugen/""><span class=""volume"">543</span>
<span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">194</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 198 (2004) (per curiam) (“[T]he focus” of quali­
fied immunity “is on whether the officer had fair notice
that her conduct was unlawful”).
   The answer to that question is yes. This Court’s prece­
dents make clear that a police officer may only deploy
deadly force against an individual if the officer “has prob­
able cause to believe that the [person] poses a threat of
serious physical harm, either to the officer or to others.”
Garner, 471 U. S., at 11; see also Graham, 490 U. S., at
397. It is equally well established that any use of lethal
force must be justified by some legitimate governmental
interest. See Scott v. Harris, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""145738""><a href=""/opinion/145738/scott-v-harris/""><span class=""volume"">550</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">372</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 383 (2007);

(SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 2–3). Consistent
with those clearly established principles, and contrary to
the majority’s conclusion, Ninth Circuit precedent predat­
ing these events further confirms that Kisela’s conduct
was clearly unreasonable. See Brosseau, 543 U. S., at 199
(“[A] body of relevant case law” may “ ‘clearly establish’ ”

Kisela plainly lacked any legitimate interest justifying the
use of deadly force against a woman who posed no objec­
tive threat of harm to officers or others, had committed no
crime, and appeared calm and collected during the police
encounter, he was not entitled to qualified immunity.
   The Ninth Circuit’s opinion in Deorle v. Rutherford, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""775749""><a href=""/opinion/775749/richard-leo-deorle-v-greg-rutherford-butte-county-deputy-sheriff-mick/""><span class=""volume"">272</span>
<span class=""reporter"">F.3d</span> <span class=""page"">1272</span></a></span><pre class=""inline""> (2001) proves the point. In that case, the police
encountered a man who had reportedly been acting “errat­
ically.” Id., at 1276. The man was “verbally abusive,”
shouted “ ‘kill me’ ” at the officers, screamed that he would
“ ‘kick [the] ass’ ” of one of the officers, and “brandish[ed] a
hatchet at a police officer,” ultimately throwing it “into a
clump of trees when told to put it down.” Id., at 1276–
1277. The officers also observed the man carrying an
unloaded crossbow in one hand and what appeared to be
“a can or a bottle of lighter fluid in the other.” Id., at
1277. The man discarded the crossbow when instructed to
do so by the police and then steadily walked toward one of
the officers. Ibid. In response, that officer, without giving
a warning, shot the man in the face with beanbag rounds.
Id., at 1278. The man suffered serious injuries, including
multiple fractures to his cranium and the loss of his left
eye. Ibid.
   The Ninth Circuit denied qualified immunity to the
officer, concluding that his use of force was objectively
unreasonable under clearly established law. Id., at 1285–
1286. The court held, “Every police officer should know
that it is objectively unreasonable to shoot . . . an unarmed
man who: has committed no serious offense, is mentally or
emotionally disturbed, has been given no warning of the
imminent use of such a significant degree of force, poses
no risk of flight, and presents no objectively reasonable
threat to the safety of the officer or other individuals.” Id.,
at 1285.
   The same holds true here. Like the man in Deorle,
                 Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)           9

                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

Hughes committed no serious crime, had been given no
warning of the imminent use of force, posed no risk of
flight, and presented no objectively reasonable threat to
the safety of officers or others. In fact, Hughes presented
even less of a danger than the man in Deorle, for, unlike
him, she did not threaten to “kick [their] ass,” did not
appear agitated, and did not raise her kitchen knife or
make any aggressive gestures toward the police or Chad­
wick. If the police officers acted unreasonably in shooting
the agitated, screaming man in Deorle with beanbag bul­
lets, a fortiori Kisela acted unreasonably in shooting the
calm-looking, stationary Hughes with real bullets. In my
view, Deorle and the precedent it cites place the unlawful­
ness of Kisela’s conduct “ ‘beyond debate.’ ” Wesby, 583
U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 15).
   The majority strains mightily to distinguish Deorle, to
no avail. It asserts, for instance, that, unlike the man in
Deorle, Hughes was “armed with a large knife.” Ante, at 7.
But that is not a fair characterization of the record, par­
ticularly at this procedural juncture. Hughes was not
“armed” with a knife. She was holding “a kitchen knife—
an everyday household item which can be used as a
weapon but ordinarily is a tool for safe, benign purposes”—
down at her side with the blade pointed away from Chad­
wick. </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">862</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.</span> <span class=""page"">3d</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, at 788 (Berzon, J., concurring in denial of
rehearing en banc). Hughes also spoke calmly with
Chadwick during the events at issue, did not raise the
knife, and made no other aggressive movements, under­
mining any suggestion that she was a threat to Chadwick
or anyone else. Similarly, the majority asserts that
Hughes was “within striking distance” of Chadwick, ante,
at 7, but that stretches the facts and contravenes this
Court’s repeated admonition that inferences must be
drawn in the exact opposite direction, i.e., in favor of
Hughes. See Tolan, 572 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8). The
facts, properly viewed, show that, when she was shot,
10                   KISELA v. HUGHES

                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

Hughes had stopped and stood still about six feet away
from Chadwick. Whether Hughes could “strik[e]” Chad­
wick from that particular distance, even though the kitchen
knife was held down at her side, is an inference that
should be drawn by the jury, not this Court.
   The majority next posits that Hughes, unlike the man in
Deorle, “ignored the officers’ orders to drop the” kitchen
knife. Ante, at 7. Yet again, the majority here draws
inferences in favor of Kisela, instead of Hughes. The
available evidence would allow a reasonable jury to find
that Hughes did not hear or register the officers’ swift
commands and that Kisela, like his fellow officers on the
scene, should have realized that as well. See supra, at 3–
4. Accordingly, at least at the summary-judgment stage,
the Court is mistaken in distinguishing Deorle based on
Hughes’ ostensible disobedience to the officers’ directives.
   The majority also implies that Deorle is distinguishable
because the police in that case observed the man over a
40-minute period, whereas the situation here unfolded in
less than a minute. Ante, at 7. But that fact favors
Hughes, not Kisela. The only reason this case unfolded in
such an abrupt timeframe is because Kisela, unlike his
fellow officer, showed no interest in trying to talk further
to Hughes or use a “lesser means” of force. See Record
120–121, 304.
   Finally, the majority passingly notes that “this Court
has already instructed the Court of Appeals not to read
[Deorle] too broadly.” Ante, at 7 (citing City and County of
San Francisco v. Sheehan, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">575</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">___, ___–___ (2015)
(slip op., at 13–14)). But the Court in Sheehan concluded
that Deorle was plainly distinguishable because, unlike in
Deorle, the officers there confronted a woman who “was
dangerous, recalcitrant, law-breaking, and out of sight.”
575 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14). As explained above,
however, Hughes was none of those things: She did not
threaten or endanger the officers or Chadwick, she did not

break any laws, and she was visible to the officers on the
scene. See supra, at 2–4. Thus, there simply is no basis
for the Court’s assertion that “ ‘the differences between
[Deorle] and the case before us leap from the page.’ ” Ante,
at 7 (quoting Sheehan, 575 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14)).
   Deorle, moreover, is not the only case that provided fair
notice to Kisela that shooting Hughes under these circum­
stances was unreasonable. For instance, the Ninth Circuit
has held that the use of deadly force against an individual
holding a semiautomatic rifle was unconstitutional where
the individual “did not point the gun at the officers and
apparently was not facing them when they shot him the
first time.” Curnow v. Ridgecrest Police, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""574389""><a href=""/opinion/574389/kenneth-christopher-curnow-a-minor-by-and-through-his-guardian-ad-litem/""><span class=""volume"">952</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.2d</span> <span class=""page"">321</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">,
325 (1991). Similarly, in Harris v. Roderick, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""746949""><a href=""/opinion/746949/97-cal-daily-op-serv-7610-97-daily-journal-dar-12280-kevin-l/""><span class=""volume"">126</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.3d</span>
<span class=""page"">1189</span></a></span><pre class=""inline""> (1997), the Ninth Circuit held that the officer unrea­
sonably used deadly force against a man who, although
armed, made “no threatening movement” or “aggressive
move of any kind.” Id., at 1203.* Both Curnow and Har-
ris establish that, where, as here, an individual with a
weapon poses no objective and immediate threat to officers
or third parties, law enforcement cannot resort to exces­
sive force. See Harris, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">126</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.</span> <span class=""page"">3d</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, at 1201 (“Law enforce­
ment officers may not shoot to kill unless, at a minimum,
the suspect presents an immediate threat to the officers,
or is fleeing and his escape will result in a serious threat
of injury to persons”).
   If all that were not enough, decisions from several other
Circuits illustrate that the Fourth Amendment clearly

  Against this wall of case law, the majority points to a

sonably could have believed that Hughes posed an imme­
diate danger. But Blanford involved far different circum­
stances. In that case, officers observed a man walking
through a neighborhood brandishing a 2½-foot cavalry
sword; officers commanded the man to drop the sword,
identified themselves as police, and warned “ ‘We’ll shoot.’ ”
Id., at 1112–1113. The man responded with “a loud growl­
ing or roaring sound,” which increased the officers’ concern
that he posed a risk of harm. Id., at 1113. In an effort to
“evade [police] authority,” the man, while still wielding the
sword, tried to enter a home, thus prompting officers to
open fire to protect anyone who might be inside. Id., at

force was reasonable in those circumstances. See id., at
1119.
  This case differs significantly from Blanford in several
key respects. Unlike the man in Blanford, Hughes held a
kitchen knife down by her side, as compared to a 2½-foot
sword; she appeared calm and collected, and did not make
threatening noises or gestures toward the officers on the
scene; she stood still in front of her own home, and was not
wandering about the neighborhood, evading law enforce­
ment, or attempting to enter another house. Moreover,
unlike the officers in Blanford, Kisela never verbally
identified himself as an officer and never warned Hughes
that he was going to shoot before he did so. Given these
significant differences, no reasonable officer would believe
that Blanford justified Kisela’s conduct. The majority’s
conclusion to the contrary is fanciful.
                         *     *     *
   In sum, precedent existing at the time of the shooting
clearly established the unconstitutionality of Kisela’s
conduct. The majority’s decision, no matter how much it
says otherwise, ultimately rests on a faulty premise: that
those cases are not identical to this one. But that is not
the law, for our cases have never required a factually
identical case to satisfy the “clearly established” standard.
Hope, 536 U. S., at 739. It is enough that governing law
places “the constitutionality of the officer’s conduct beyond
debate.” Wesby, 583 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (internal
quotation marks omitted). Because, taking the facts in the
light most favorable to Hughes, it is “beyond debate” that
Kisela’s use of deadly force was objectively unreasonable,
he was not entitled to summary judgment on the basis of
qualified immunity.
                          III
  For the foregoing reasons, it is clear to me that the

Court of Appeals got it right. But even if that result were
not so clear, I cannot agree with the majority’s apparent

to warrant “the extraordinary remedy of a summary re­
versal.” Major League Baseball Players Assn. v. Garvey,

(“Summary reversals of courts of appeals are unusual
under any circumstances”). This is not such a case. The
relevant facts are hotly disputed, and the qualified-
immunity question here is, at the very best, a close call.
Rather than letting this case go to a jury, the Court de­
cides to intervene prematurely, purporting to correct an
error that is not at all clear.
   This unwarranted summary reversal is symptomatic of
“a disturbing trend regarding the use of this Court’s re­
sources” in qualified-immunity cases. Salazar-Limon v.

   The majority today exacerbates that troubling asym­
metry. Its decision is not just wrong on the law; it also
sends an alarming signal to law enforcement officers and
the public. It tells officers that they can shoot first and
think later, and it tells the public that palpably unreason­
able conduct will go unpunished. Because there is noth-
ing right or just under the law about this, I respectfully
dissent.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
          ANDREW KISELA v. AMY HUGHES
   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED 

    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

               No. 17–467.    Decided April 2, 2018


  PER CURIAM.
  Petitioner Andrew Kisela, a police officer in Tucson,
Arizona, shot respondent Amy Hughes. Kisela and two
other officers had arrived on the scene after hearing a
police radio report that a woman was engaging in erratic
behavior with a knife. They had been there but a few
minutes, perhaps just a minute. When Kisela fired,
Hughes was holding a large kitchen knife, had taken steps
toward another woman standing nearby, and had refused
to drop the knife after at least two commands to do so.
The question is whether at the time of the shooting
Kisela’s actions violated clearly established law.
  The record, viewed in the light most favorable to
Hughes, shows the following. In May 2010, somebody in
Hughes’ neighborhood called 911 to report that a woman
was hacking a tree with a kitchen knife. Kisela and an-
other police officer, Alex Garcia, heard about the report
over the radio in their patrol car and responded. A few
minutes later the person who had called 911 flagged down
the officers; gave them a description of the woman with
the knife; and told them the woman had been acting errat-
ically. About the same time, a third police officer, Lindsay
Kunz, arrived on her bicycle.
  Garcia spotted a woman, later identified as Sharon
Chadwick, standing next to a car in the driveway of a
nearby house. A chain-link fence with a locked gate sepa-
rated Chadwick from the officers. The officers then saw
another woman, Hughes, emerge from the house carrying
a large knife at her side. Hughes matched the description
2                     KISELA v. HUGHES

                          Per Curiam

of the woman who had been seen hacking a tree. Hughes
walked toward Chadwick and stopped no more than six
feet from her.
   All three officers drew their guns. At least twice they
told Hughes to drop the knife. Viewing the record in the
light most favorable to Hughes, Chadwick said “take it
easy” to both Hughes and the officers. Hughes appeared
calm, but she did not acknowledge the officers’ presence or
drop the knife. The top bar of the chain-link fence blocked
Kisela’s line of fire, so he dropped to the ground and shot
Hughes four times through the fence. Then the officers
jumped the fence, handcuffed Hughes, and called para-
medics, who transported her to a hospital. There she was
treated for non-life-threatening injuries. Less than a
minute had transpired from the moment the officers saw
Chadwick to the moment Kisela fired shots.
   All three of the officers later said that at the time of the
shooting they subjectively believed Hughes to be a threat
to Chadwick. After the shooting, the officers discovered
that Chadwick and Hughes were roommates, that Hughes
had a history of mental illness, and that Hughes had been
upset with Chadwick over a $20 debt. In an affidavit
produced during discovery, Chadwick said that a few
minutes before the shooting her boyfriend had told her
Hughes was threatening to kill Chadwick’s dog, named
Bunny. Chadwick “came home to find” Hughes “somewhat
distressed,” and Hughes was in the house holding Bunny
“in one hand and a kitchen knife in the other.” Hughes
asked Chadwick if she “wanted [her] to use the knife on
the dog.” The officers knew none of this, though. Chad-
wick went outside to get $20 from her car, which is when
the officers first saw her. In her affidavit Chadwick said
that she did not feel endangered at any time. Ibid. Based
on her experience as Hughes’ roommate, Chadwick stated
that Hughes “occasionally has episodes in which she acts
inappropriately,” but “she is only seeking attention.” 2

Record 108.
   Hughes sued Kisela under Rev. Stat. §1979, 42 U. S. C.
§1983, alleging that Kisela had used excessive force in
violation of the Fourth Amendment. The District Court
granted summary judgment to Kisela, but the Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. 862 F. 3d 775
(2016).
   The Court of Appeals first held that the record, viewed
in the light most favorable to Hughes, was sufficient to
demonstrate that Kisela violated the Fourth Amendment.
See id., at 782. The court next held that the violation was
clearly established because, in its view, the constitutional
violation was obvious and because of Circuit precedent
that the court perceived to be analogous. Id., at 785.
Kisela filed a petition for rehearing en banc. Over the
dissent of seven judges, the Court of Appeals denied it.
Kisela then filed a petition for certiorari in this Court.
That petition is now granted.
   In one of the first cases on this general subject, Tennes-
see v. Garner, 471 U. S. 1 (1985), the Court addressed the
constitutionality of the police using force that can be deadly.
There, the Court held that “[w]here the officer has proba-
ble cause to believe that the suspect poses a threat of
serious physical harm, either to the officer or to others, it
is not constitutionally unreasonable to prevent escape by
using deadly force.” Id., at 11.
   In Graham v. Connor, 490 U. S. 386, 396 (1989), the
Court held that the question whether an officer has used
excessive force “requires careful attention to the facts and
circumstances of each particular case, including the sever-
ity of the crime at issue, whether the suspect poses an
immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others,
and whether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting
to evade arrest by flight.” “The ‘reasonableness’ of a par-
ticular use of force must be judged from the perspective of
a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the
4                    KISELA v. HUGHES

                         Per Curiam

20/20 vision of hindsight.” Ibid. And “[t]he calculus of
reasonableness must embody allowance for the fact that
police officers are often forced to make split-second judg-
ments—in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and
rapidly evolving—about the amount of force that is neces-
sary in a particular situation.” Id., at 396–397.
    Here, the Court need not, and does not, decide whether
Kisela violated the Fourth Amendment when he used
deadly force against Hughes. For even assuming a Fourth
Amendment violation occurred—a proposition that is not
at all evident—on these facts Kisela was at least entitled
to qualified immunity.
    “Qualified immunity attaches when an official’s conduct
does not violate clearly established statutory or constitu-
tional rights of which a reasonable person would have
known.” White v. Pauly, 580 U. S. ___, ___ (2017) (per
curiam) (slip op., at 6) (alterations and internal quotation
marks omitted). “Because the focus is on whether the
officer had fair notice that her conduct was unlawful,
reasonableness is judged against the backdrop of the law
at the time of the conduct.” Brosseau v. Haugen, 543 U. S.
194, 198 (2004) (per curiam).
    Although “this Court’s caselaw does not require a case
directly on point for a right to be clearly established,
existing precedent must have placed the statutory or
constitutional question beyond debate.” White, 580 U. S.,
at ___ (slip op., at 6) (internal quotation marks omitted).
“In other words, immunity protects all but the plainly
incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.”
Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). This Court has
“ ‘repeatedly told courts—and the Ninth Circuit in particu-
lar—not to define clearly established law at a high level of
generality.’ ”   City and County of San Francisco v.
Sheehan, 575 U. S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 13) (quoting
Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U. S. 731, 742 (2011)); see also
Brosseau, supra, at 198–199.

   “[S]pecificity is especially important in the Fourth
Amendment context, where the Court has recognized that
it is sometimes difficult for an officer to determine how the
relevant legal doctrine, here excessive force, will apply to
the factual situation the officer confronts.” Mullenix v.
Luna, 577 U. S. ___, ___ (2015) (per curiam) (slip op., at 5)
(internal quotation marks omitted). Use of excessive force
is an area of the law “in which the result depends very
much on the facts of each case,” and thus police officers
are entitled to qualified immunity unless existing prece-
dent “squarely governs” the specific facts at issue. Id., at
___ (slip op., at 6) (internal quotation marks omitted and
emphasis deleted). Precedent involving similar facts can
help move a case beyond the otherwise “hazy border be-
tween excessive and acceptable force” and thereby provide
an officer notice that a specific use of force is unlaw-
ful. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (internal quotation marks
omitted).
   “Of course, general statements of the law are not inher-
ently incapable of giving fair and clear warning to offic-
ers.” White, 580 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7) (internal
quotation marks omitted). But the general rules set forth
in “Garner and Graham do not by themselves create clearly
established law outside an ‘obvious case.’ ” Ibid. Where
constitutional guidelines seem inapplicable or too remote,
it does not suffice for a court simply to state that an officer
may not use unreasonable and excessive force, deny quali-
fied immunity, and then remit the case for a trial on the
question of reasonableness. An officer “cannot be said to
have violated a clearly established right unless the right’s
contours were sufficiently definite that any reasonable
official in the defendant’s shoes would have understood
that he was violating it.” Plumhoff v. Rickard, 572 U. S.
___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 12). That is a necessary part of
the qualified-immunity standard, and it is a part of the
standard that the Court of Appeals here failed to imple-
6                    KISELA v. HUGHES

                         Per Curiam

ment in a correct way.
   Kisela says he shot Hughes because, although the offic-
ers themselves were in no apparent danger, he believed
she was a threat to Chadwick. Kisela had mere seconds to
assess the potential danger to Chadwick. He was con-
fronted with a woman who had just been seen hacking a
tree with a large kitchen knife and whose behavior was
erratic enough to cause a concerned bystander to call 911
and then flag down Kisela and Garcia. Kisela was sepa-
rated from Hughes and Chadwick by a chain-link fence;
Hughes had moved to within a few feet of Chadwick; and
she failed to acknowledge at least two commands to drop
the knife. Those commands were loud enough that Chad-
wick, who was standing next to Hughes, heard them. This
is far from an obvious case in which any competent officer
would have known that shooting Hughes to protect Chad-
wick would violate the Fourth Amendment.
   The Court of Appeals made additional errors in conclud-
ing that its own precedent clearly established that Kisela
used excessive force. To begin with, “even if a controlling
circuit precedent could constitute clearly established law
in these circumstances, it does not do so here.” Sheehan,
supra, at ___ (slip op., at 13). In fact, the most analogous
Circuit precedent favors Kisela. See Blanford v. Sacra-
mento County, 406 F. 3d 1110 (CA9 2005). In Blanford,
the police responded to a report that a man was walking
through a residential neighborhood carrying a sword and
acting in an erratic manner. Id., at 1112. There, as here,
the police shot the man after he refused their commands
to drop his weapon (there, as here, the man might not
have heard the commands). Id., at 1113. There, as here,
the police believed (perhaps mistakenly), that the man
posed an immediate threat to others. Ibid. There, the
Court of Appeals determined that the use of deadly force
did not violate the Fourth Amendment. Id., at 1119.
Based on that decision, a reasonable officer could have
                 Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)            7

                          Per Curiam

believed the same thing was true in the instant case.
  In contrast, not one of the decisions relied on by the
Court of Appeals—Deorle v. Rutherford, 272 F. 3d 1272
(CA9 2001), Glenn v. Washington County, 673 F. 3d 864
(CA9 2011), and Harris v. Roderick, 126 F. 3d 1189 (CA9
1997)—supports denying Kisela qualified immunity. As
for Deorle, this Court has already instructed the Court of
Appeals not to read its decision in that case too broadly in
deciding whether a new set of facts is governed by clearly
established law. Sheehan, 572 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op.,
at 13–14). Deorle involved a police officer who shot an
unarmed man in the face, without warning, even though
the officer had a clear line of retreat; there were no by-
standers nearby; the man had been “physically compliant
and generally followed all the officers’ instructions”; and
he had been under police observation for roughly 40
minutes. 272 F. 3d, at 1276, 1281–1282. In this case,
by contrast, Hughes was armed with a large knife; was
within striking distance of Chadwick; ignored the officers’
orders to drop the weapon; and the situation unfolded in
less than a minute. “Whatever the merits of the decision
in Deorle, the differences between that case and the case
before us leap from the page.” Sheehan, supra, at ___ (slip
op., at 14).
  Glenn, which the panel described as “[t]he most analo-
gous Ninth Circuit case,” 862 F. 3d, at 783, was decided
after the shooting at issue here. Thus, Glenn “could not
have given fair notice to [Kisela]” because a reasonable
officer is not required to foresee judicial decisions that do
not yet exist in instances where the requirements of the
Fourth Amendment are far from obvious. Brosseau, 543
U. S., at 200, n. 4. Glenn was therefore “of no use in the
clearly established inquiry.” Brosseau, supra, at 200, n. 4.
Other judges brought this mistaken or misleading citation
to the panel’s attention while Kisela’s petition for rehear-
ing en banc was pending before the Court of Appeals. 862
8                     KISELA v. HUGHES

                          Per Curiam

F.3d, at 795, n. 2 (Ikuta, J., dissenting from denial of
rehearing en banc). The panel then amended its opinion,
but nevertheless still attempted to “rely on Glenn as illus-
trative, not as indicative of the clearly established law in
2010.” Id., at 784, n. 2 (majority opinion). The panel
failed to explain the difference between “illustrative” and
“indicative” precedent, and none is apparent.
   The amended opinion also asserted, for the first time
and without explanation, that the Court of Appeals’ deci-
sion in Harris clearly established that the shooting here
was unconstitutional. Id., at 785. The new mention of
Harris replaced a reference in the panel’s first opinion to
Glenn—the case that postdated the shooting at issue here.
Compare 841 F. 3d 1081, 1090 (CA9 2016) (“As indicated
by Glenn and Deorle, . . . that right was clearly estab-
lished”), with 862 F. 3d, at 785 (“As indicated by Deorle
and Harris, . . . that right was clearly established”).
   The panel’s reliance on Harris “does not pass the
straight-face test.” 862 F. 3d, at 797 (opinion of Ikuta, J.).
In Harris, the Court of Appeals determined that an FBI
sniper, who was positioned safely on a hilltop, used exces-
sive force when he shot a man in the back while the man
was retreating to a cabin during what has been referred to
as the Ruby Ridge standoff. 126 F. 3d, at 1202–1203.
Suffice it to say, a reasonable police officer could miss the
connection between the situation confronting the sniper at
Ruby Ridge and the situation confronting Kisela in
Hughes’ front yard.
   For these reasons, the petition for certiorari is granted;
the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed; and the
case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion.
                                              It is so ordered.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
          ANDREW KISELA v. AMY HUGHES
   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED 

    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

              No. 17–467.   Decided April 2, 2018


   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG
joins, dissenting.
   Officer Andrew Kisela shot Amy Hughes while she was
speaking with her roommate, Sharon Chadwick, outside of
their home. The record, properly construed at this stage,
shows that at the time of the shooting: Hughes stood
stationary about six feet away from Chadwick, appeared
“composed and content,” Appellant’s Excerpts of Record
109 (Record), and held a kitchen knife down at her side
with the blade facing away from Chadwick. Hughes was
nowhere near the officers, had committed no illegal act,
was suspected of no crime, and did not raise the knife in
the direction of Chadwick or anyone else. Faced with
these facts, the two other responding officers held their
fire, and one testified that he “wanted to continue trying
verbal command[s] and see if that would work.” Id., at
120. But not Kisela. He thought it necessary to use deadly
force, and so, without giving a warning that he would
open fire, he shot Hughes four times, leaving her seriously
injured.
   If this account of Kisela’s conduct sounds unreasonable,
that is because it was. And yet, the Court today insulates
that conduct from liability under the doctrine of qualified
immunity, holding that Kisela violated no “clearly estab­
lished” law. See ante, at 5–6. I disagree. Viewing the
facts in the light most favorable to Hughes, as the Court
must at summary judgment, a jury could find that Kisela
violated Hughes’ clearly established Fourth Amendment
rights by needlessly resorting to lethal force. In holding
2                     KISELA v. HUGHES

                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

otherwise, the Court misapprehends the facts and misap­
plies the law, effectively treating qualified immunity as an
absolute shield. I therefore respectfully dissent.
                               I
   This case arrives at our doorstep on summary judgment,
so we must “view the evidence . . . in the light most favor­
able to” Hughes, the nonmovant, “with respect to the
central facts of this case.” Tolan v. Cotton, 572 U. S. ___,
___ (2014) (per curiam) (slip op., at 8). The majority pur­
ports to honor this well-settled principle, but its efforts fall
short. Although the majority sets forth most of the rele­
vant events that transpired, it conspicuously omits several
critical facts and draws premature inferences that bear on
the qualified-immunity inquiry. Those errors are fatal to
its analysis, because properly construing all of the facts in
the light most favorable to Hughes, and drawing all infer­
ences in her favor, a jury could find that the following
events occurred on the day of Hughes’ encounter with the
Tucson police.
   On May 21, 2010, Kisela and Officer-in-Training Alex
Garcia received a “ ‘check welfare’ ” call about a woman
chopping away at a tree with a knife. 862 F. 3d 775, 778
(CA9 2016). They responded to the scene, where they
were informed by the person who had placed the call (not
Chadwick) that the woman with the knife had been acting
“erratically.” Ibid. A third officer, Lindsay Kunz, later
joined the scene. The officers observed Hughes, who
matched the description given to the officers of the woman
alleged to have been cutting the tree, emerge from a house
with a kitchen knife in her hand. Hughes exited the front
door and approached Chadwick, who was standing outside
in the driveway.
   Hughes then stopped about six feet from Chadwick,
holding the kitchen knife down at her side with the blade
pointed away from Chadwick. Hughes and Chadwick

                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

conversed with one another; Hughes appeared “composed
and content,” Record 109, and did not look angry. See 862
F. 3d, at 778. At no point during this exchange did
Hughes raise the kitchen knife or verbally threaten to
harm Chadwick or the officers. Chadwick later averred
that, during the incident, she was never in fear of Hughes
and “was not the least bit threatened by the fact that
[Hughes] had a knife in her hand” and that Hughes “never
acted in a threatening manner.” Record 110–111. The
officers did not observe Hughes commit any crime, nor was
Hughes suspected of committing one. See 862 F. 3d, at
780.
   Nevertheless, the officers hastily drew their guns and
ordered Hughes to drop the knife. The officers gave that
order twice, but the commands came “in quick succession.”
Id., at 778. The evidence in the record suggests that
Hughes may not have heard or understood the officers’
commands and may not have been aware of the officers’
presence at all. Record 109–110, 195, 323–324 (Officer
Kunz’s testimony that “it seemed as though [Hughes]
didn’t even know we were there,” and “[i]t was like she
didn’t hear us almost”); id., at 304 (Officer Garcia’s testi­
mony that Hughes acted “almost as if we weren’t there”).
Although the officers were in uniform, they never verbally
identified themselves as law enforcement officers.
   Kisela did not wait for Hughes to register, much less
respond to, the officers’ rushed commands. Instead, Kisela
immediately and unilaterally escalated the situation.
Without giving any advance warning that he would shoot,
and without attempting less dangerous methods to deesca­
late the situation, he dropped to the ground and shot four
times at Hughes (who was stationary) through a chain-
link fence. After being shot, Hughes fell to the ground,
screaming and bleeding from her wounds. She looked at
the officers and asked, “ ‘Why’d you shoot me?’ ” Id., at
308. Hughes was immediately transported to the hospital,
4                     KISELA v. HUGHES

                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

where she required treatment for her injuries. Kisela
alone resorted to deadly force in this case. Confronted
with the same circumstances as Kisela, neither of his
fellow officers took that drastic measure.
                              II
   Police officers are not entitled to qualified immunity if
“(1) they violated a federal statutory or constitutional
right, and (2) the unlawfulness of their conduct was ‘clearly
established at the time.’ ” District of Columbia v. Wesby,
583 U. S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 13) (quoting Reichle v.
Howards, 566 U. S. 658, 664 (2012)). Faithfully applying
that well-settled standard, the Ninth Circuit held that a
jury could find that Kisela violated Hughes’ clearly estab­
lished Fourth Amendment rights. That conclusion was
correct.
                               A
   I begin with the first step of the qualified-immunity
inquiry: whether there was a violation of a constitutional
right. Hughes alleges that Kisela violated her Fourth
Amendment rights by deploying excessive force against
her. In assessing such a claim, courts must ask “whether
the officers’ actions are ‘objectively reasonable’ in light of
the facts and circumstances confronting them.” Graham
v. Connor, 490 U. S. 386, 397 (1989). That inquiry “re­
quires careful attention to the facts and circumstances of
each particular case, including the severity of the crime at
issue, whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to
the safety of the officers or others, and whether he is
actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by
flight.” Id., at 396; see also Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U. S.
1, 11 (1985). All of those factors (and others) support the
Ninth Circuit’s conclusion that a jury could find that
Kisela’s use of deadly force was objectively unreasonable.
862 F. 3d, at 779–782. Indeed, the panel’s resolution of
                 Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)           5

                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

this question was so convincing that not a single judge on
the Ninth Circuit, including the seven who dissented from
denial of rehearing en banc, expressly disputed that con­
clusion. See id., at 791–799 (opinion of Ikuta, J.). Neither
does the majority here, which simply assumes without
deciding that “a Fourth Amendment violation occurred.”
Ante, at 4.
   First, Hughes committed no crime and was not suspected
of committing a crime. The officers were responding to a
“check welfare” call, which reported no criminal activity,
and the officers did not observe any illegal activity while
at the scene. The mere fact that Hughes held a kitchen
knife down at her side with the blade pointed away from
Chadwick hardly elevates the situation to one that justi­
fies deadly force.
   Second, a jury could reasonably conclude that Hughes
presented no immediate or objective threat to Chadwick or
the other officers. It is true that Kisela had received a
report that a woman matching Hughes’ description had
been acting erratically. But the police officers themselves
never witnessed any erratic conduct. Instead, when
viewed in the light most favorable to Hughes, the record
evidence of what the police encountered paints a calmer
picture. It shows that Hughes was several feet from
Chadwick and even farther from the officers, she never
made any aggressive or threatening movements, and she
appeared “composed and content” during the brief
encounter.
   Third, Hughes did not resist or evade arrest. Based on
this record, there is significant doubt as to whether she
was aware of the officers’ presence at all, and evidence
suggests that Hughes did not hear the officers’ swift com­
mands to drop the knife.
   Finally, the record suggests that Kisela could have, but
failed to, use less intrusive means before deploying deadly
force. 862 F. 3d, at 781. For instance, Hughes submitted
6                    KISELA v. HUGHES

                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

expert testimony concluding that Kisela should have used
his Taser and that shooting his gun through the fence was
dangerous because a bullet could have fragmented against
the fence and hit Chadwick or his fellow officers. Ibid.; see
also Bryan v. MacPherson, 630 F. 3d 805, 831 (CA9 2010)
(noting that “police are required to consider what other
tactics if any were available to effect the arrest” and
whether there are “clear, reasonable, and less intrusive
alternatives” (internal quotation marks and alteration
omitted)). Consistent with that assessment, the other two
officers on the scene declined to fire at Hughes, and one of
them explained that he was inclined to use “some of the
lesser means” than shooting, including verbal commands,
because he believed there was time “[t]o try to talk
[Hughes] down.” Record 120–121. That two officers on
the scene, presented with the same circumstances as
Kisela, did not use deadly force reveals just how unneces­
sary and unreasonable it was for Kisela to fire four shots
at Hughes. See Plumhoff v. Rickard, 572 U. S. ___, ___
(2014) (slip op., at 8) (“We analyze [the objective reason-
ableness] question from the perspective of a reasonable
officer on the scene” (internal quotation marks omitted)).
  Taken together, the foregoing facts would permit a jury
to conclude that Kisela acted outside the bounds of the
Fourth Amendment by shooting Hughes four times.
                               B
  Rather than defend the reasonableness of Kisela’s con­
duct, the majority sidesteps the inquiry altogether and
focuses instead on the “clearly established” prong of the
qualified-immunity analysis. Ante, at 4. To be “ ‘clearly
established’ . . . [t]he contours of the right must be suffi­
ciently clear that a reasonable official would understand
that what he is doing violates that right.” Anderson v.
Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 640 (1987). That standard is not
nearly as onerous as the majority makes it out to be. As
                  Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)             7

                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

even the majority must acknowledge, ante, at 4, this Court
has long rejected the notion that “an official action is
protected by qualified immunity unless the very action in
question has previously been held unlawful,” Anderson,
483 U. S., at 640. “[O]fficials can still be on notice that
their conduct violates established law even in novel factual
circumstances.” Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U. S. 730, 741 (2002).
At its core, then, the “clearly established” inquiry boils
down to whether Kisela had “fair notice” that he acted
unconstitutionally. See ibid.; Brosseau v. Haugen, 543
U. S. 194, 198 (2004) (per curiam) (“[T]he focus” of quali­
fied immunity “is on whether the officer had fair notice
that her conduct was unlawful”).
   The answer to that question is yes. This Court’s prece­
dents make clear that a police officer may only deploy
deadly force against an individual if the officer “has prob­
able cause to believe that the [person] poses a threat of
serious physical harm, either to the officer or to others.”
Garner, 471 U. S., at 11; see also Graham, 490 U. S., at
397. It is equally well established that any use of lethal
force must be justified by some legitimate governmental
interest. See Scott v. Harris, 550 U. S. 372, 383 (2007);
Mullenix v. Luna, 577 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2015)
(SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 2–3). Consistent
with those clearly established principles, and contrary to
the majority’s conclusion, Ninth Circuit precedent predat­
ing these events further confirms that Kisela’s conduct
was clearly unreasonable. See Brosseau, 543 U. S., at 199
(“[A] body of relevant case law” may “ ‘clearly establish’ ”
the violation of a constitutional right); Ashcroft v. al-Kidd,
563 U. S. 731, 746 (2011) (KENNEDY, J., concurring)
(“[Q]ualified immunity is lost when plaintiffs point either
to ‘cases of controlling authority in their jurisdiction at the
time of the incident’ or to ‘a consensus of cases of persua­
sive authority such that a reasonable officer could not
have believed that his actions were lawful’ ” (quoting
8                     KISELA v. HUGHES

                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

Wilson v. Layne, 526 U. S. 603, 617 (1999))). Because
Kisela plainly lacked any legitimate interest justifying the
use of deadly force against a woman who posed no objec­
tive threat of harm to officers or others, had committed no
crime, and appeared calm and collected during the police
encounter, he was not entitled to qualified immunity.
   The Ninth Circuit’s opinion in Deorle v. Rutherford, 272
F. 3d 1272 (2001) proves the point. In that case, the police
encountered a man who had reportedly been acting “errat­
ically.” Id., at 1276. The man was “verbally abusive,”
shouted “ ‘kill me’ ” at the officers, screamed that he would
“ ‘kick [the] ass’ ” of one of the officers, and “brandish[ed] a
hatchet at a police officer,” ultimately throwing it “into a
clump of trees when told to put it down.” Id., at 1276–
1277. The officers also observed the man carrying an
unloaded crossbow in one hand and what appeared to be
“a can or a bottle of lighter fluid in the other.” Id., at
1277. The man discarded the crossbow when instructed to
do so by the police and then steadily walked toward one of
the officers. Ibid. In response, that officer, without giving
a warning, shot the man in the face with beanbag rounds.
Id., at 1278. The man suffered serious injuries, including
multiple fractures to his cranium and the loss of his left
eye. Ibid.
   The Ninth Circuit denied qualified immunity to the
officer, concluding that his use of force was objectively
unreasonable under clearly established law. Id., at 1285–
1286. The court held, “Every police officer should know
that it is objectively unreasonable to shoot . . . an unarmed
man who: has committed no serious offense, is mentally or
emotionally disturbed, has been given no warning of the
imminent use of such a significant degree of force, poses
no risk of flight, and presents no objectively reasonable
threat to the safety of the officer or other individuals.” Id.,
at 1285.
   The same holds true here. Like the man in Deorle,
                 Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)           9

                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

Hughes committed no serious crime, had been given no
warning of the imminent use of force, posed no risk of
flight, and presented no objectively reasonable threat to
the safety of officers or others. In fact, Hughes presented
even less of a danger than the man in Deorle, for, unlike
him, she did not threaten to “kick [their] ass,” did not
appear agitated, and did not raise her kitchen knife or
make any aggressive gestures toward the police or Chad­
wick. If the police officers acted unreasonably in shooting
the agitated, screaming man in Deorle with beanbag bul­
lets, a fortiori Kisela acted unreasonably in shooting the
calm-looking, stationary Hughes with real bullets. In my
view, Deorle and the precedent it cites place the unlawful­
ness of Kisela’s conduct “ ‘beyond debate.’ ” Wesby, 583
U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 15).
   The majority strains mightily to distinguish Deorle, to
no avail. It asserts, for instance, that, unlike the man in
Deorle, Hughes was “armed with a large knife.” Ante, at 7.
But that is not a fair characterization of the record, par­
ticularly at this procedural juncture. Hughes was not
“armed” with a knife. She was holding “a kitchen knife—
an everyday household item which can be used as a
weapon but ordinarily is a tool for safe, benign purposes”—
down at her side with the blade pointed away from Chad­
wick. 862 F. 3d, at 788 (Berzon, J., concurring in denial of
rehearing en banc). Hughes also spoke calmly with
Chadwick during the events at issue, did not raise the
knife, and made no other aggressive movements, under­
mining any suggestion that she was a threat to Chadwick
or anyone else. Similarly, the majority asserts that
Hughes was “within striking distance” of Chadwick, ante,
at 7, but that stretches the facts and contravenes this
Court’s repeated admonition that inferences must be
drawn in the exact opposite direction, i.e., in favor of
Hughes. See Tolan, 572 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8). The
facts, properly viewed, show that, when she was shot,
10                   KISELA v. HUGHES

                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

Hughes had stopped and stood still about six feet away
from Chadwick. Whether Hughes could “strik[e]” Chad­
wick from that particular distance, even though the kitchen
knife was held down at her side, is an inference that
should be drawn by the jury, not this Court.
   The majority next posits that Hughes, unlike the man in
Deorle, “ignored the officers’ orders to drop the” kitchen
knife. Ante, at 7. Yet again, the majority here draws
inferences in favor of Kisela, instead of Hughes. The
available evidence would allow a reasonable jury to find
that Hughes did not hear or register the officers’ swift
commands and that Kisela, like his fellow officers on the
scene, should have realized that as well. See supra, at 3–
4. Accordingly, at least at the summary-judgment stage,
the Court is mistaken in distinguishing Deorle based on
Hughes’ ostensible disobedience to the officers’ directives.
   The majority also implies that Deorle is distinguishable
because the police in that case observed the man over a
40-minute period, whereas the situation here unfolded in
less than a minute. Ante, at 7. But that fact favors
Hughes, not Kisela. The only reason this case unfolded in
such an abrupt timeframe is because Kisela, unlike his
fellow officer, showed no interest in trying to talk further
to Hughes or use a “lesser means” of force. See Record
120–121, 304.
   Finally, the majority passingly notes that “this Court
has already instructed the Court of Appeals not to read
[Deorle] too broadly.” Ante, at 7 (citing City and County of
San Francisco v. Sheehan, 575 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2015)
(slip op., at 13–14)). But the Court in Sheehan concluded
that Deorle was plainly distinguishable because, unlike in
Deorle, the officers there confronted a woman who “was
dangerous, recalcitrant, law-breaking, and out of sight.”
575 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14). As explained above,
however, Hughes was none of those things: She did not
threaten or endanger the officers or Chadwick, she did not
                      Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)                    11

                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

break any laws, and she was visible to the officers on the
scene. See supra, at 2–4. Thus, there simply is no basis
for the Court’s assertion that “ ‘the differences between
[Deorle] and the case before us leap from the page.’ ” Ante,
at 7 (quoting Sheehan, 575 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14)).
   Deorle, moreover, is not the only case that provided fair
notice to Kisela that shooting Hughes under these circum­
stances was unreasonable. For instance, the Ninth Circuit
has held that the use of deadly force against an individual
holding a semiautomatic rifle was unconstitutional where
the individual “did not point the gun at the officers and
apparently was not facing them when they shot him the
first time.” Curnow v. Ridgecrest Police, 952 F. 2d 321,
325 (1991). Similarly, in Harris v. Roderick, 126 F. 3d
1189 (1997), the Ninth Circuit held that the officer unrea­
sonably used deadly force against a man who, although
armed, made “no threatening movement” or “aggressive
move of any kind.” Id., at 1203.* Both Curnow and Har-
ris establish that, where, as here, an individual with a
weapon poses no objective and immediate threat to officers
or third parties, law enforcement cannot resort to exces­
sive force. See Harris, 126 F. 3d, at 1201 (“Law enforce­
ment officers may not shoot to kill unless, at a minimum,
the suspect presents an immediate threat to the officers,
or is fleeing and his escape will result in a serious threat
of injury to persons”).
   If all that were not enough, decisions from several other
Circuits illustrate that the Fourth Amendment clearly
——————
  * The majority insists that reliance on Harris fails the “ ‘straight-face
test’ ” because Harris involved an FBI sniper on a hilltop who shot a
man while he was retreating to a cabin during a standoff. Ante, at 8
(quoting 862 F. 3d, at 797 (opinion of Ikuta, J.)). If anything, though,
the context of Harris could be viewed as more dangerous than the
context here because, unlike Hughes, the suspect in Harris had en­
gaged in a firefight with other officers the previous day, during which
an officer was shot. See 126 F. 3d, at 1193–1194.
12                   KISELA v. HUGHES

                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

forbids the use of deadly force against a person who is
merely holding a knife but not threatening anyone with it.
See, e.g., McKinney v. DeKalb County, 997 F. 2d 1440,
1442 (CA11 1993) (affirming denial of summary judgment
based on qualified immunity to officer who shot a person
holding a butcher knife in one hand and a foot-long stick
in the other, where the person threw the stick and began
to rise from his seated position); Reyes v. Bridgwater, 362
Fed. Appx. 403, 404–405 (CA5 2010) (reversing grant of
summary judgment based on qualified immunity to officer
who shot a person holding a kitchen knife in his apart­
ment entryway, even though he refused to follow the
officer’s multiple commands to drop the knife); Duong v.
Telford Borough, 186 Fed. Appx. 214, 215, 217 (CA3 2006)
(affirming denial of summary judgment based on qualified
immunity to officer who shot a person holding a knife
because a reasonable jury could conclude that the plaintiff
was sitting down and pointing the knife away from the
officer at the time he was shot and had not received any
warnings to drop the knife).
  Against this wall of case law, the majority points to a
single Ninth Circuit decision, Blanford v. Sacramento
County, 406 F. 3d 1110 (2005), as proof that Kisela rea­
sonably could have believed that Hughes posed an imme­
diate danger. But Blanford involved far different circum­
stances. In that case, officers observed a man walking
through a neighborhood brandishing a 2½-foot cavalry
sword; officers commanded the man to drop the sword,
identified themselves as police, and warned “ ‘We’ll shoot.’ ”
Id., at 1112–1113. The man responded with “a loud growl­
ing or roaring sound,” which increased the officers’ concern
that he posed a risk of harm. Id., at 1113. In an effort to
“evade [police] authority,” the man, while still wielding the
sword, tried to enter a home, thus prompting officers to
open fire to protect anyone who might be inside. Id., at
1113, 1118. The Ninth Circuit concluded that use of deadly
                 Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)           13

                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

force was reasonable in those circumstances. See id., at
1119.
  This case differs significantly from Blanford in several
key respects. Unlike the man in Blanford, Hughes held a
kitchen knife down by her side, as compared to a 2½-foot
sword; she appeared calm and collected, and did not make
threatening noises or gestures toward the officers on the
scene; she stood still in front of her own home, and was not
wandering about the neighborhood, evading law enforce­
ment, or attempting to enter another house. Moreover,
unlike the officers in Blanford, Kisela never verbally
identified himself as an officer and never warned Hughes
that he was going to shoot before he did so. Given these
significant differences, no reasonable officer would believe
that Blanford justified Kisela’s conduct. The majority’s
conclusion to the contrary is fanciful.
                         *     *     *
   In sum, precedent existing at the time of the shooting
clearly established the unconstitutionality of Kisela’s
conduct. The majority’s decision, no matter how much it
says otherwise, ultimately rests on a faulty premise: that
those cases are not identical to this one. But that is not
the law, for our cases have never required a factually
identical case to satisfy the “clearly established” standard.
Hope, 536 U. S., at 739. It is enough that governing law
places “the constitutionality of the officer’s conduct beyond
debate.” Wesby, 583 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (internal
quotation marks omitted). Because, taking the facts in the
light most favorable to Hughes, it is “beyond debate” that
Kisela’s use of deadly force was objectively unreasonable,
he was not entitled to summary judgment on the basis of
qualified immunity.
                          III
  For the foregoing reasons, it is clear to me that the
14                   KISELA v. HUGHES

                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

Court of Appeals got it right. But even if that result were
not so clear, I cannot agree with the majority’s apparent
view that the decision below was so manifestly incorrect as
to warrant “the extraordinary remedy of a summary re­
versal.” Major League Baseball Players Assn. v. Garvey,
532 U. S. 504, 512–513 (2001) (Stevens, J., dissenting). “A
summary reversal is a rare disposition, usually reserved
by this Court for situations in which the law is settled and
stable, the facts are not in dispute, and the decision below
is clearly in error.” Schweiker v. Hansen, 450 U. S. 785,
791 (1981) (Marshall, J., dissenting); Office of Personnel
Management v. Richmond, 496 U. S. 414, 422 (1990)
(“Summary reversals of courts of appeals are unusual
under any circumstances”). This is not such a case. The
relevant facts are hotly disputed, and the qualified-
immunity question here is, at the very best, a close call.
Rather than letting this case go to a jury, the Court de­
cides to intervene prematurely, purporting to correct an
error that is not at all clear.
   This unwarranted summary reversal is symptomatic of
“a disturbing trend regarding the use of this Court’s re­
sources” in qualified-immunity cases. Salazar-Limon v.
Houston, 581 U. S. ___, ___ (2017) (SOTOMAYOR, J., dis­
senting from denial of certiorari) (slip op., at 8). As I have
previously noted, this Court routinely displays an un­
flinching willingness “to summarily reverse courts for
wrongly denying officers the protection of qualified im­
munity” but “rarely intervene[s] where courts wrongly
afford officers the benefit of qualified immunity in these
same cases.” Id., at ___–___ (slip op., at 8–9); see also
Baude, Is Qualified Immunity Unlawful? 106 Cal. L. Rev.
45, 82 (2018) (“[N]early all of the Supreme Court’s quali­
fied immunity cases come out the same way—by finding
immunity for the officials”); Reinhardt, The Demise of

and Enforcement of Constitutional Rights and Some Par­
ticularly Unfortunate Consequences, 113 Mich. L. Rev.
1219, 1244–1250 (2015). Such a one-sided approach to
qualified immunity transforms the doctrine into an abso­
lute shield for law enforcement officers, gutting the deter­
rent effect of the Fourth Amendment.
   The majority today exacerbates that troubling asym­
metry. Its decision is not just wrong on the law; it also
sends an alarming signal to law enforcement officers and
the public. It tells officers that they can shoot first and
think later, and it tells the public that palpably unreason­
able conduct will go unpunished. Because there is noth-
ing right or just under the law about this, I respectfully
dissent.

          Nos. 17–7171 and 17–7545. Decided April 2, 2018


  The petitions for writs of certiorari are denied.
  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, dissenting from the denial of
certiorari.
  Twice now this Court has declined to vacate and remand
to the Florida Supreme Court in cases where that court
failed to address a substantial Eighth Amendment chal­
lenge to capital defendants’ sentences, and twice I have
dissented from that inaction. See Truehill v. Florida, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">583</span>
<span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">___, ___ (2017); Middleton v. Florida, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">583</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">___,
___ (2018). Four petitioners were involved in those cases.
Today we add two more to the list, for a total of at least six
capital defendants who now face execution by the State
without having received full consideration of their claims.
  It should not be necessary for me to explain again why
petitioners’ challenges are substantial, why the Florida
Supreme Court should have addressed those challenges, or
why this Court has an obligation to intervene. Neverthe­
less, recent developments at the Florida Supreme Court
compel me to dissent in full once again.
  As a reminder, like the petitioners in Truehill and Mid-
dleton, Jesse Guardado and Steven Cozzie challenge their

<span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">320</span></a></span><pre class=""inline""> (1985). I summarized those challenges in Mid-
dleton as follows:
          “[Petitioners] were sentenced to death under a Flor­
       ida capital sentencing scheme that this Court has
       since declared unconstitutional. See Hurst v. Florida,
       577 U. S. ___ (2016). Relying on the unanimity of the
       juries’ recommendations of death, the Florida Su­
       preme Court post-Hurst declined to disturb the peti­
       tioners’ death sentences, reasoning that the unanim-
       ity ensured that jurors had made the necessary
       findings of fact under Hurst. By doing so, the Florida
       Supreme Court effectively transformed the pre-Hurst
       jury recommendations into binding findings of fact
       with respect to petitioners’ death sentences.” 583
       U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 1–2) (dissenting from de­
       nial of certiorari).
Reliance on those pre-Hurst recommendations, rendered
after the juries repeatedly were instructed that their role
was merely advisory, implicates Caldwell, where this
Court recognized that “the uncorrected suggestion that the
responsibility for any ultimate determination of death will
rest with others presents an intolerable danger that the
jury will in fact choose to minimize the importance of its
role,” in contravention of the Eighth Amendment. 472
U. S., at 333.
  Following the dissent from the denial of certiorari in
Truehill, the Florida Supreme Court has on at least two
occasions taken the position that it has, in fact, considered
and rejected petitioners’ Caldwell-based challenges.1 In
Franklin v. State, — So. 3d —, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">2018</span> <span class=""reporter"">WL</span> <span class=""page"">897427</span></span><pre class=""inline""> (Feb. 15,

2018) (per curiam), the Florida Supreme Court stated
that, “prior to Hurst, [it] repeatedly rejected Caldwell
challenges to the standard jury instructions.” Id., at *3.
The decisions it cited in support of that pre-Hurst prece­
dent rely on one fact: “Informing the jury that its recom­
mended sentence is ‘advisory’ is a correct statement of
Florida law and does not violate Caldwell.” Rigterink v.
State, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""2494456""><a href=""/opinion/2494456/rigterink-v-state/""><span class=""volume"">66</span> <span class=""reporter"">So. 3d</span> <span class=""page"">866</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 897 (Fla. 2011) (per curiam); Globe v.

(stating that it has rejected Caldwell challenges to the
standard jury instructions, citing cases that similarly rely
on the fact that the instructions accurately reflect the
advisory nature of the jurors’ role). But of course, “the
rationale underlying [this] previous rejection of the Cald-
well challenge [has] now [been] undermined by this Court
in Hurst,” Truehill, 583 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2), and
the Florida Supreme Court must therefore “grapple with
the Eighth Amendment implications of [its subsequent
post-Hurst] holding” that “then-advisory jury findings are
now binding and sufficient to satisfy Hurst,” Middleton,
583 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2). Its pre-Hurst precedent
thus does not absolve the Florida Supreme Court from
addressing petitioners’ new post-Hurst Caldwell-based
challenges.
   The Florida Supreme Court in Franklin did not stop
there, however. It went on to state that it had “also re­
jected Caldwell-related Hurst claims” more recently, citing
Truehill v. State, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">211</span> <span class=""reporter"">So. 3d</span> <span class=""page"">930</span></span><pre class=""inline""> (Fla. 2017) (per curiam),

riam), noting that “the defendants in Oliver and Truehill
petitioned the United States Supreme Court for a writ of

denied.” Franklin, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">2018</span> <span class=""reporter"">WL</span> <span class=""page"">897427</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, *3. This is a surpris­
ing statement, because Quentin Truehill and Terence
Oliver were the two petitioners whose claims were at issue
in my dissent in Truehill. Franklin did not discuss that

dissent, joined by two other Justices, which specifically
noted that “the Florida Supreme Court has failed to ad­
dress” the important Caldwell-based challenge. Truehill,
583 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1). Earlier this month, in
rejecting a motion to vacate a sentence brought by peti­
tioner Jesse Guardado, the Florida Supreme Court again
held that it had “considered and rejected” post-Hurst
Caldwell-based challenges, citing Franklin, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">2018</span> <span class=""reporter"">WL</span>
<span class=""page"">897427</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, and Truehill, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">211</span> <span class=""reporter"">So. 3d</span> <span class=""page"">930</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. Guardado v. State,

   It is hard to understand how the Florida Supreme Court
“considered and rejected” these Caldwell-based challenges
based on its decisions in Truehill and Oliver. Those cases
did not mention or discuss Caldwell. Nor did they men­
tion or discuss the fundamental Eighth Amendment prin­
ciple it announced: “It is constitutionally impermissible to
rest a death sentence on a determination made by a sen­
tencer who has been led to believe that the responsibility

——————
   2 As petitioner Guardado explained in his supplemental brief, in addi­

tion to the postconviction motion that forms the basis of the petition
currently before our Court, he also filed a motion to vacate his sentence.
See Supp. Brief for Petitioner 1. It was with respect to that motion that
the Florida Supreme Court issued the opinion stating that it had
“considered and rejected” the Caldwell-based challenge. No mention of
the Caldwell-based claim was made in the Florida Supreme Court
opinion directly under review in this petition. </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">226</span> <span class=""reporter"">So. 3d</span> <span class=""page"">213</span></span><pre class=""inline""> (2017).
In fact, petitioner Guardado filed a motion with the Florida Supreme
Court for rehearing and clarification of the denial of his postconviction
motion, noting, inter alia, that the opinion “unreasonably omitted any
consideration or discussion of [his] arguments regarding the interplay
between Caldwell and Hurst.” App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 17–7171, p.
68a. The Florida Supreme Court denied the motion in an unreasoned
one-line order. See id., at 7a. Petitioner Steven Cozzie also moved for
rehearing below, similarly arguing in part that the Florida Supreme
Court “overlooked the effect of instructing [his] jury many times that its
recommendation was advisory only,” citing Caldwell. App. to Pet. for
Cert. in No. 17–7545, p. 66a. The Florida Supreme Court also denied
the motion in an unreasoned one-line order. See id., at 43a.

for determining the appropriateness of the defendant’s
death rests elsewhere.” Caldwell, 472 U. S., at 328–329.
In neither Truehill nor Oliver did the Florida Supreme
Court discuss the grave Eighth Amendment concerns
implicated by its finding that the Hurst violations in those
cases are harmless, a conclusion that transforms those
advisory jury recommendations into binding findings of
fact. Although the Florida Supreme Court noted in
Truehill that the defendant in that case “contends that he
is entitled to relief pursuant to Hurst v. Florida because
the jury in his case was repeatedly instructed regarding
the non-binding nature of its verdict,” </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">211</span> <span class=""reporter"">So.</span> <span class=""page"">3d</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, at 955,
that was the first and last reference to that argument.
There was absolutely no reference to the argument in
Oliver. </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">214</span> <span class=""reporter"">So. 3d</span> <span class=""page"">606</span></span><pre class=""inline"">.3
   Therefore, the Florida Supreme Court has (again)4 failed
to address an important and substantial Eighth Amend­
ment challenge to capital defendants’ sentences post-
Hurst. Nothing in its pre-Hurst precedent, nor in its
opinions in Truehill and Oliver, addresses or resolves
these substantial Caldwell-based challenges. This Court
can and should intervene in the face of this troubling
situation.
   I dissent.

dleton as follows:
          “[Petitioners] were sentenced to death under a Flor­

currently before our Court, he also filed a motion to vacate his sentence.
See Supp. Brief for Petitioner 1. It was with respect to that motion that

HALL, AS PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ESTATE OF 

  HALL AND AS SUCCESSOR TRUSTEE OF THE ETHLYN 

   LOUISE HALL FAMILY TRUST v. HALL ET AL. 


CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
                  THE THIRD CIRCUIT

   No. 16–1150. Argued January 16, 2018—Decided March 27, 2018
Respondent Samuel Hall served as caretaker and legal advisor to his
  mother Ethlyn Hall, a property owner in the United States Virgin Is-
  lands. After falling out with Samuel, Ethlyn transferred her property
  into a trust and designated her daughter, petitioner Elsa Hall, as her
  successor trustee. Ethlyn sued Samuel and his law firm over the
  handling of her affairs (the “trust case”). When Ethlyn died, Elsa
  took Ethlyn’s place as trustee and as plaintiff. Samuel later filed a
  separate complaint against Elsa in her individual capacity (the “indi-
  vidual case”).
     On Samuel’s motion, the District Court consolidated the trust and
  individual cases under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 42(a). The
  District Court held a single trial of the consolidated cases. In the in-
  dividual case, the jury returned a verdict for Samuel, but the District
  Court granted Elsa a new trial. In the trust case, the jury returned a
  verdict against Elsa, and she filed a notice of appeal from the judg-
  ment in that case. Samuel moved to dismiss the appeal on jurisdic-
  tional grounds, arguing that the judgment in the trust case was not
  final and appealable because his claims against Elsa remained unre-
  solved in the individual case. The Court of Appeals for the Third Cir-
  cuit agreed and dismissed the appeal.
Held: When one of several cases consolidated under Rule 42(a) is finally
 decided, that decision confers upon the losing party the immediate
 right to appeal, regardless of whether any of the other consolidated
 cases remain pending. Pp. 4–18.
    (a) Title </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">28</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §1291 vests the courts of appeals with jurisdic-

    tion over “appeals from all final decisions of the district courts,” ex-
    cept those directly appealable to this Court. Under §1291, “any liti-
    gant armed with a final judgment from a lower federal court is enti-
    tled to take an appeal.” Arizona v. Manypenny, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""110465""><a href=""/opinion/110465/arizona-v-manypenny/""><span class=""volume"">451</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">232</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 244.
    Here an appeal would normally lie from the judgment in the trust
    case. But Samuel argues that because the trust and individual cases
    were consolidated under Rule 42(a)(2), they merged and should be
    regarded as one case, such that the judgment in the trust case was
    merely interlocutory and not appealable before the consolidated cases
    in the aggregate are finally resolved. Pp. 4–5.
       (b) Rule 42(a)(2) provides that if “actions before the court involve a
    common question of law or fact, the court may . . . consolidate the ac-
    tions.” The meaning of the term “consolidate” in this context is am-
    biguous. But the term has a legal lineage stretching back at least to
    the first federal consolidation statute, enacted by Congress in 1813.
    Act of July 22, 1813, §3, 3 Stat. 21 (later codified as Rev. Stat. §921
    and </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">28</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §734 (1934 ed.)). That history makes clear that one of
    multiple cases consolidated under the Rule retains its independent
    character, at least to the extent it is appealable when finally re-
    solved, regardless of any ongoing proceedings in the other cases.
    Pp. 5–6.
       (c) Under the consolidation statute—which was in force for 125
    years, until its replacement by Rule 42(a)—consolidation was under-
    stood not as completely merging the constituent cases into one, but as
    enabling more efficient case management while preserving the dis-
    tinct identities of the cases and rights of the separate parties in them.
    See, e.g., Rich v. Lambert, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""86699""><a href=""/opinion/86699/rich-v-lambert/""><span class=""volume"">12</span> <span class=""reporter"">How.</span> <span class=""page"">347</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">; Mutual Life Ins. Co. v.

United States, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""94707""><a href=""/opinion/94707/stone-v-united-states/""><span class=""volume"">167</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">178</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">. Just
    five years before Rule 42(a) became law, the Court reiterated that,
    under the consolidation statute, consolidation did not result in the
    merger of constituent cases. Johnson v. Manhattan R. Co., </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""102108""><a href=""/opinion/102108/johnson-v-manhattan-r-co/""><span class=""volume"">289</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span>
    <span class=""page"">479</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 496–497. This body of law supports the inference that, prior to
    Rule 42(a), a judgment completely resolving one of several consoli-
    dated cases was an immediately appealable final decision. Pp. 6–12.
       (d) Rule 42(a) was expressly modeled on the consolidation statute.
    Because the Rule contained no definition of “consolidate,” the term
    presumably carried forward the same meaning ascribed to it under
    the statute and reaffirmed in Johnson.
       Samuel nonetheless asserts that “consolidate” took on a different
    meaning under Rule 42(a). He describes the Rule as permitting two
    forms of consolidation: consolidation for limited purposes and consol-
    idation for all purposes. He locates textual authority for the former
    in a new provision, subsection (a)(1), which permits courts to “join for
    hearing or trial any or all matters at issue in the actions.” And he
                     Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)                     3

                                Syllabus

  contends that subsection (a)(2), so as not to be superfluous, must
  permit the merger of cases that have been consolidated for all pur-
  poses into a single, undifferentiated case. But the narrow grant of
  authority in subsection (a)(1) cannot fairly be read as the exclusive
  source of a district court’s power to consolidate cases for limited pur-
  poses, because there is much more to litigation than hearings or tri-
  als. Instead, that undisputed power must stem from subsection
  (a)(2). That defeats Samuel’s argument that interpreting subsection
  (a)(2) to adopt the traditional understanding of consolidation would
  render it duplicative of subsection (a)(1), and that subsection (a)(2)
  therefore must permit courts to merge the actions into a single unit.
     Moreover, a Federal Rules Advisory Committee would not take a
  term that had long meant that separate actions do not merge into
  one, and silently and abruptly reimagine the same term to mean that
  they do. Nothing in the pertinent Committee proceedings supports
  the notion that Rule 42(a) was meant to overturn the settled under-
  standing of consolidation; the Committee simply commented that
  Rule 42(a) “is based upon” its statutory predecessor, “but insofar as
  the statute differs from this rule, it is modified.” Advisory Commit-

  App., p. 887. The limited extent to which this Court has addressed
  consolidation since adoption of Rule 42(a) confirms that the tradi-
  tional understanding remains in place. See, e.g., Bank Markazi v. Pe-
  terson, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">578</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">___, ___–___; Butler v.

     This decision does not mean that district courts may not consoli-
  date cases for all purposes in appropriate circumstances. But con-
  stituent cases retain their separate identities at least to the extent
  that a final decision in one is immediately appealable by the losing
  party. Pp. 12–17.

                                [March 27, 2018]


  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
  Three Terms ago, we held that one of multiple cases
consolidated for multidistrict litigation under </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">28</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">.
§1407 is immediately appealable upon an order disposing
of that case, regardless of whether any of the others re-
main pending. Gelboim v. Bank of America Corp., 574
U. S. ___ (2015). We left open, however, the question
whether the same is true with respect to cases consoli-
dated under Rule 42(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Proce-
dure. Id., at ___, n. 4 (slip op., at 7, n. 4). This case pre-
sents that question.
                            I
  Petitioner Elsa Hall and respondent Samuel Hall are
siblings enmeshed in a long-running family feud. Their
mother, Ethlyn Hall, lived and owned property in the
United States Virgin Islands. Samuel, a lawyer in the
Virgin Islands, served as Ethlyn’s caretaker and provided
her with legal assistance. But trouble eventually came to
2                      HALL v. HALL

                     Opinion of the Court

paradise, and Samuel and Ethlyn fell out over Samuel’s
management of Ethlyn’s real estate holdings. During a
visit from Elsa, Ethlyn established an inter vivos trust,
transferred all of her property into the trust, and desig-
nated Elsa as her successor trustee. Ethlyn then moved to
Miami—under circumstances disputed by the parties—to
live with her daughter.
   The family squabble made its way to court in May 2011.
Ethlyn, acting in her individual capacity and as trustee of
her inter vivos trust, sued Samuel and his law firm in
Federal District Court (the “trust case”).          Ethlyn’s
claims—for breach of fiduciary duty, legal malpractice,
conversion, fraud, and unjust enrichment—concerned the
handling of her affairs by Samuel and his law firm before
she left for Florida.
   Then Ethlyn died, and Elsa stepped into her shoes as
trustee and accordingly as plaintiff in the trust case.
Samuel promptly filed counterclaims in that case against
Elsa—in both her individual and representative capaci-
ties—for intentional infliction of emotional distress, fraud,
breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, and tortious inter-
ference. Samuel contended that Elsa had turned their
mother against him by taking advantage of Ethlyn’s alleged
mental frailty. But Samuel ran into an obstacle: Elsa was
not a party to the trust case in her individual capacity
(only Ethlyn had been). So Samuel filed a new complaint
against Elsa in her individual capacity in the same Dis-
trict Court (the “individual case”), raising the same claims
that he had asserted as counterclaims in the trust case.
   The trust and individual cases initially proceeded along
separate tracks. Eventually, on Samuel’s motion, the
District Court consolidated the cases under Rule 42(a) of
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, ordering that “[a]ll
submissions in the consolidated case shall be filed in” the
docket assigned to the trust case. App. to Pet. for Cert.
A–15.

                     Opinion of the Court

  Just before the trial commenced, the District Court
dismissed from the trust case Samuel’s counterclaims
against Elsa. Those claims remained in the individual
case. The parties then tried the consolidated cases to-
gether before a jury.
  In the individual case, the jury returned a verdict for
Samuel on his intentional infliction of emotional distress
claim against Elsa, awarding him $500,000 in compensa-
tory damages and $1.5 million in punitive damages. The
clerk entered judgment in that case, but the District Court
granted Elsa a new trial, which had the effect of reopening
the judgment. The individual case remains pending before
the District Court.
  In the trust case, the jury returned a verdict against
Elsa, in her representative capacity, on her claims against
Samuel and his law firm. The clerk entered judgment in
that case directing that Elsa “recover nothing” and that
“the action be dismissed on the merits.” Id., at A–12.
  Elsa filed a notice of appeal from the District Court’s
judgment in the trust case. Samuel and his law firm
moved to dismiss the appeal on jurisdictional grounds,
arguing that the judgment was not final and appealable
because his claims against Elsa remained unresolved in
the individual case. The Court of Appeals for the Third
Circuit agreed. When two cases have been consolidated
for all purposes, the court reasoned, a final decision on one
set of claims is generally not appealable while the second
set remains pending. The court explained that it consid-
ers “whether a less-than-complete judgment is appealable”
on a “case-by-case basis.” 679 Fed. Appx. 142, 145 (2017).
Here, the fact that the claims in the trust and individual
cases had been “scheduled together and tried before a
single jury” “counsel[ed] in favor of keeping the claims
together on appeal.” Ibid. The court dismissed Elsa’s
appeal for lack of jurisdiction.

   Had the District Court never consolidated the trust and
individual cases, there would be no question that Elsa
could immediately appeal from the judgment in the trust
case. Title </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">28</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §1291 vests the courts of appeals
with jurisdiction over “appeals from all final decisions of
the district courts,” except those directly appealable to this
Court. A final decision “ends the litigation on the merits
and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the
judgment.” Ray Haluch Gravel Co. v. Central Pension
Fund of Operating Engineers and Participating Employ-
ers, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">571</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">177</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 183 (2014). The archetypal final deci-
sion is “one[ ] that trigger[s] the entry of judgment.” Mo-
hawk Industries, Inc. v. Carpenter, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""1751""><a href=""/opinion/1751/mohawk-industries-inc-v-carpenter/""><span class=""volume"">558</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">100</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 103
(2009). Appeal from such a final decision is a “matter of
right.” Gelboim, 574 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1). Under
§1291, “any litigant armed with a final judgment from a
lower federal court is entitled to take an appeal,” Arizona
v. Manypenny, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""110465""><a href=""/opinion/110465/arizona-v-manypenny/""><span class=""volume"">451</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">232</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 244 (1981), which generally
must be filed within 30 days, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">28</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §2107(a).
   Here the jury’s verdict against Elsa resolved all of the
claims in the trust case, and the clerk accordingly entered
judgment in that case providing that “the action be dis-
missed on the merits.” App. to Pet. for Cert. A–12. With
the entry of judgment, the District Court “completed its
adjudication of [Elsa’s] complaint and terminated [her]
action.” Gelboim, 574 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7). An
appeal would normally lie from that judgment.
   But, Samuel contends, there is more to the litigation
than the suit Elsa pursued against him in her representa-
tive capacity. There is also his suit against her in her
individual capacity, which has not yet been decided.
Because the District Court consolidated the trust and
                 Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)            5

                     Opinion of the Court

individual cases under Rule 42(a)(2), he argues, they
merged and should be regarded as one case. Viewed that
way, the judgment in the trust case was merely interlocu-
tory, and more remains to be done in the individual case
before the consolidated cases in the aggregate are finally
resolved and subject to appeal.
                               B
   Rule 42(a)—entitled “[c]onsolidation”—provides that if
“actions before the court involve a common question of law
or fact, the court may” take one of three measures. First,
the court may “join for hearing or trial any or all matters
at issue in the actions.” Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 42(a)(1).
Second, the court may “consolidate the actions.” Rule
42(a)(2). Third, the court may “issue any other orders to
avoid unnecessary cost or delay.” Rule 42(a)(3). Whether
the judgment entered in the trust case is an immediately
appealable final decision turns on the effect of consolida-
tion under Rule 42(a).
   Samuel, looking to dictionary definitions, asserts that
the “plain meaning of the phrase ‘consolidate the actions’
is . . . to unite two or more actions into one whole—that is,
to join them into a single case.” Brief for Respondents 23
(citing Black’s Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014); some inter-
nal quotation marks and alterations omitted). But the
meaning of “consolidate” in the present context is am-
biguous. When Rule 42(a) was adopted, the term was gener-
ally defined, as it is now, as meaning to “unite, as various
particulars, into one mass or body; to bring together in
close union; to combine.” Webster’s New International
Dictionary 570 (2d ed. 1942). Consolidation can thus
sometimes signify the complete merger of discrete units:
“The company consolidated two branches.” But the term
can also mean joining together discrete units without
causing them to lose their independent character. The
United States, for example, is composed of States
6                       HALL v. HALL

                      Opinion of the Court

“unite[d], as various particulars, into one mass or body,”
“br[ought] together in close union,” or “combine[d].” Yet
all agree that entry into our Union “by no means implies
the loss of distinct and individual existence . . . by the
States.” Texas v. White, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""88061""><a href=""/opinion/88061/texas-v-white/""><span class=""volume"">7</span> <span class=""reporter"">Wall.</span> <span class=""page"">700</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 725 (1869). “She
consolidated her books” hardly suggests that the “books”
became “book.” The very metaphor Samuel offers—that
consolidation “make[s] two one, like marriage”—highlights
this point. Tr. of Oral Arg. 56. However dear to each
other, spouses would be surprised to hear that their union
extends beyond the metaphysical. This is not a plain
meaning case.
   It is instead about a term—consolidate—with a legal
lineage stretching back at least to the first federal consoli-
dation statute, enacted by Congress in 1813. Act of July
22, 1813, §3, 3 Stat. 21 (later codified as Rev. Stat. §921
and </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">28</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §734 (1934 ed.)). Over 125 years, this
Court, along with the courts of appeals and leading trea-
tises, interpreted that term to mean the joining together—
but not the complete merger—of constituent cases. Those
authorities particularly emphasized that constituent cases
remained independent when it came to judgments and
appeals. Rule 42(a), promulgated in 1938, was expressly
based on the 1813 statute. The history against which Rule
42(a) was adopted resolves any ambiguity regarding the
meaning of “consolidate” in subsection (a)(2). It makes
clear that one of multiple cases consolidated under the
Rule retains its independent character, at least to the
extent it is appealable when finally resolved, regardless of
any ongoing proceedings in the other cases.
                           C
  Lord Mansfield pioneered the consolidation of related
cases in England, and the practice quickly took root in
American courts. See Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Hillmon, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""93380""><a href=""/opinion/93380/mutual-life-ins-co-v-hillmon/""><span class=""volume"">145</span>

                      Opinion of the Court

newly formed federal courts, when confronted with “causes
of like nature, or relative to the same question,” to “make
such orders and rules concerning proceedings therein as
may be conformable to the principles and usages belonging
to courts for avoiding unnecessary costs or delay in the
administration of justice” and to “consolidate[]” the causes
when it “shall appear reasonable.” §3, 3 Stat. 21. This
consolidation statute applied at law, equity, and admi-
ralty, see 1 W. Rose, A Code of Federal Procedure §823(a)
(1907) (Rose), and remained in force for 125 years, until its
replacement by Rule 42(a).
   From the outset, we understood consolidation not as
completely merging the constituent cases into one, but
instead as enabling more efficient case management while
preserving the distinct identities of the cases and the
rights of the separate parties in them. In Rich v. Lambert,
</pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""86699""><a href=""/opinion/86699/rich-v-lambert/""><span class=""volume"">12</span> <span class=""reporter"">How.</span> <span class=""page"">347</span></a></span><pre class=""inline""> (1852), for example, we considered an appeal
from several consolidated cases in admiralty. The appel-
lees, the owners of cargo damaged during shipment, raised
a challenge to our jurisdiction that turned on the nature of
the consolidation. At the time, we could exercise appellate
jurisdiction only over cases involving at least $2,000 in
controversy. The damages awarded to the cargo owners in
the consolidated cases surpassed $2,000 in the aggregate,
but most of the constituent cases did not individually clear
that jurisdictional hurdle. Id., at 352–353.
   We declined to view the consolidated cases as one for
purposes of appeal, concluding that we had jurisdiction
only over those constituent cases that individually in-
volved damages exceeding $2,000. Ibid. As we explained,
“although [a consolidated] proceeding assumes the form of
a joint suit, it is in reality a mere joinder of distinct causes
of action by distinct parties, arising out of a common
injury, and which are heard and determined, so far as the

involved three separate actions instituted against differ-
ent life insurance companies by one Sallie Hillmon, the
beneficiary on policies purchased by her husband John.
Sallie claimed she was entitled to the sizable proceeds of
the policies because John had died while journeying
through southern Kansas with two companions in search
of a site for a cattle ranch. The three companies countered
that John was in fact still alive, having conspired with one
of the companions to murder the other and pass his corpse
off as John’s, all as part of an insurance fraud scheme.
The trial court consolidated the cases and tried them
together. Id., at 285–287.

peremptory juror challenges to which each defendant was

that each defendant should receive the full complement of
peremptory challenges. Id., at 293. That was because,
“although the defendants might lawfully be compelled, at
the discretion of the court, to try the cases together, the
causes of action remained distinct, and required separate
verdicts and judgments; and no defendant could be de-
prived, without its consent, of any right material to its
defence . . . to which it would have been entitled if the
cases had been tried separately.” Ibid. On remand, one
case settled, and a consolidated trial of the others “re-

held that a party appealing from the judgment in one of
two cases consolidated for trial could not also raise claims
with respect to the other case. John Stone was the sole
defendant in one case and one of three defendants in the
other. Id., at 179–181. After a consolidated trial, the jury
returned a verdict in the case against Stone alone; its
verdict in the multidefendant case was set aside. Id., at
181. Stone appealed from the judgment in his case, argu-
ing that the failure to grant a peremptory challenge in the
multidefendant case affected the jury’s verdict in his. Id.,
at 189. We rejected that claim, punctiliously respecting
the distinction between the constituent cases. There was
“no merit in the objection,” we said, because in the case
before us Stone had “had the benefit of the three peremp-
tory challenges” to which he was entitled in that case.

936 (CA2 1932). In the resulting litigation, the District
Court consolidated two suits, apparently with the intent to
“effect an intervention of the parties to the [first suit] in
the [second] suit”—in other words, to make the two suits
one. Id., at 940. Judge Learned Hand, writing for the
Second Circuit on appeal, would have none of it: “consoli-
dation does not merge the suits; it is a mere matter of
convenience in administration, to keep them in step. They
remain as independent as before.” Ibid. We affirmed,
relying on Hillmon and several lower court cases reflecting
the same understanding of consolidation. Johnson, 289
U. S., at 497, n. 8. We explained once more that “consoli-
dation is permitted as a matter of convenience and econ-
omy in administration, but does not merge the suits into a
single cause, or change the rights of the parties, or make
those who are parties in one suit parties in another.” Id.,
at 496–497.
   Decisions by the Courts of Appeals, with isolated depar-
tures,* reflected the same understanding in cases involv-
ing all manners of consolidation. See, e.g., Baltimore S. S.

“sought to employ consolidation as a medium of getting
the two independent suits united,” but the Court of Ap-
peals made clear that the consolidation statute did not
authorize such action. The court explained that constitu-
ent cases sometimes “assume certain natural attitudes
toward each other, such as ‘in the nature of ’ a cross-bill or
intervention.” Id., at 838. Be that as it may, the court
continued, “this is purely a rule of convenience, and does
not result in actually making such parties defendants or
interveners in the other suit.” Ibid. The court described
“the result of consolidation” as instead “merely to try cases
together, necessitating separate verdicts and judgments or
separate decrees,” and to “leave” the constituent cases
“separate, independent action[s].” Id., at 838, 840.
   Treatises summarizing federal precedent applying the
consolidation statute also concluded that consolidated
cases “remain distinct.” 1 Rose §823(c), at 758. They
recognized that consolidated cases should “remain sepa-
rate as to parties, pleadings, and judgment,” W. Simkins,
Federal Practice 63 (rev. ed. 1923), and that “[t]here must
be separate verdicts, judgments or decrees, even although
the consolidating party wished for one verdict,” 1 Rose
§823(c), at 758; see also G. Virden, Consolidation Under
12                     HALL v. HALL

                     Opinion of the Court

Rule 42 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, in 141
F. R. D. 169, 173–174 (1992) (Virden) (“as of 1933 and the
Johnson case of that year, it was well settled that consoli-
dation in the federal courts did not merge the separate
cases into a single action”).
   Several aspects of this body of law support the inference
that, prior to Rule 42(a), a judgment completely resolving
one of several consolidated cases was an immediately
appealable final decision. We made clear, for example,
that each constituent case must be analyzed individually
on appeal to ascertain jurisdiction and to decide its dispo-
sition—a compartmentalized analysis that would be gratu-
itous if the cases had merged into a single case subject to a
single appeal. We emphasized that constituent cases
should end in separate decrees or judgments—the tradi-
tional trigger for the right to appeal, for which there would
be no need if an appeal could arise only from the resolu-
tion of the consolidated cases as a whole. We explained
that the parties to one case did not become parties to the
other by virtue of consolidation—indicating that the right
of each to pursue his individual case on appeal should not
be compromised by the litigation conduct of the other.
And, finally, we held that consolidation could not prejudice
rights to which the parties would have been due had
consolidation never occurred. Forcing an aggrieved party
to wait for other cases to conclude would substantially
impair his ability to appeal from a final decision fully
resolving his own case—a “matter of right,” Gelboim, 574
U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1), to which he was “entitled,”
Manypenny, 451 U. S., at 244.
                           D
  Against this background, two years after Johnson, the
Rules Advisory Committee began discussion of what was
to become Rule 42(a). The Rule, which became effective in
1938, was expressly modeled on its statutory predecessor,

the Act of July 22, 1813. See Advisory Committee’s Notes

App., p. 887. The Rule contained no definition of “consoli-
date,” so the term presumably carried forward the same
meaning we had ascribed to it under the consolidation
statute for 125 years, and had just recently reaffirmed in
Johnson. See Frankfurter, Some Reflections on the Read-
ing of Statutes, 47 Colum. L. Rev. 527, 537 (1947) (“if a
word is obviously transplanted from another legal source,
whether the common law or other legislation, it brings the

___ (2018) (slip op., at 10) (Federal Rule of Criminal Pro-
cedure 11(a)(2) did not silently alter existing doctrine
established by this Court’s past decisions).
  Samuel nonetheless asserts that there is a significant
distinction between the original consolidation statute and
Rule 42(a). The statute authorized district courts to “con-
solidate” related “causes when it appears reasonable to do
so” or to “make such orders and rules . . . as may be con-
formable to the usages of courts for avoiding unnecessary
costs or delay in the administration of justice.” </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">28</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">.
§734 (1934 ed.). Rule 42(a) permits district courts not only
to “consolidate the actions” (subsection (a)(2)) and “issue
any other orders to avoid unnecessary cost or delay” (sub-
section (a)(3)), but also to “join for hearing or trial any or
all matters at issue in the actions” (subsection (a)(1)).
  Whatever “consolidate” meant under the statute, Sam-
uel posits, it took on a different meaning under Rule 42(a)
with the addition of subsection (a)(1). Samuel describes
the Rule as “permit[ting] two forms of consolidation”:
consolidation that “extend[s] only to certain proceedings,”
such as discovery, and consolidation “for all purposes.”
Brief for Respondents 4–5. He locates textual authority
for the former in subsection (a)(1), which he says empow-
ers courts to “join[ ] multiple actions for procedural pur-
poses.” Id., at 23. In light of this broad grant of authority,
14                      HALL v. HALL

                      Opinion of the Court

he contends, subsection (a)(2) must provide for something
more if it is not to be superfluous. And Samuel sees that
something more as the ability to merge cases that have
been consolidated for “all purposes” into a single, undiffer-
entiated case—one appealable only when all issues in each
formerly distinct case have been decided. See id., at 22–24
(to “consolidate” separate actions is “to join them into a
single case” or “meld [them] into a single unit” (alterations
omitted)).
   We disagree. It is only by substantially overreading
subsection (a)(1) that Samuel can argue that its addition
compels a radical reinterpretation of the familiar term
“consolidate” in subsection (a)(2). The text of subsection
(a)(1) permits the joining of cases only for “hearing or
trial.” That narrow grant of authority cannot fairly be
read as the exclusive source of a district court’s power to
“join[ ] multiple actions for procedural purposes.” Brief for
Respondents 23. There is, after all, much more to litiga-
tion than hearings or trials—such as motions practice or
discovery. A district court’s undisputed ability to consoli-
date cases for such limited purposes must therefore stem
from subsection (a)(2). That defeats Samuel’s argument
that interpreting subsection (a)(2) to adopt the traditional
understanding of consolidation would render it “wholly
duplicative of [subsection] (a)(1),” and that subsection
(a)(2) “therefore must permit courts . . . to ‘consolidate’ the
actions themselves into a single unit.” Id., at 23–24.
Samuel’s reinterpretation of “consolidate” is, in other
words, a solution in search of a problem.
   We think, moreover, that if Rule 42(a) were meant to
transform consolidation into something sharply contrary
to what it had been, we would have heard about it. Con-
gress, we have held, “does not alter the fundamental
details” of an existing scheme with “vague terms” and
“subtle device[s].” Whitman v. American Trucking Assns.,

                     Opinion of the Court

(slip op., at 10). That is true in spades when it comes to
the work of the Federal Rules Advisory Committees.
Their laborious drafting process requires years of effort
and many layers of careful review before a proposed Rule
is presented to this Court for possible submission to Con-
gress. See Report of Advisory Committee on Rules for
Civil Procedure (Apr. 1937) (describing the exhaustive
process undertaken to draft the first Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure). No sensible draftsman, let alone a Federal
Rules Advisory Committee, would take a term that had
meant, for more than a century, that separate actions do
not merge into one, and silently and abruptly reimagine
the same term to mean that they do.
    Similarly, nothing in the pertinent proceedings of the
Rules Advisory Committee supports the notion that Rule
42(a) was meant to overturn the settled understanding of
consolidation. See United States v. Vonn, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""118487""><a href=""/opinion/118487/united-states-v-vonn/""><span class=""volume"">535</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">55</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 64,
n. 6 (2002) (Advisory Committee Notes are “a reliable
source of insight into the meaning of a rule”). In this
instance, the Committee simply commented that Rule
42(a) “is based upon” its statutory predecessor, “but inso-
far as the statute differs from this rule, it is modified.”

mittee did not identify any specific instance in which Rule
42(a) changed the statute, let alone the dramatic trans-
formation Samuel would have us recognize. See Virden
174–181 (evaluating the history of the development of
Rule 42(a) and finding no evidence that the Committee
intended a shift in meaning along the lines proposed by
Samuel). This is significant because when the Committee
intended a new rule to change existing federal practice, it
typically explained the departure. See, e.g., Advisory

    As a leading treatise explained at the time, through
consolidation under Rule 42(a) “one or many or all of the
phases of the several actions may be merged. But merger
is never so complete in consolidation as to deprive any
party of any substantial rights which he may have pos-
sessed had the actions proceeded separately.” 3 J. Moore
& J. Friedman, Moore’s Federal Practice §42.01, pp. 3050–
3051 (1938). Thus, “separate verdicts and judgments are
normally necessary.” Id., at 3051, n. 12.
    The limited extent to which this Court has addressed
consolidation since adoption of Rule 42(a) confirms the
traditional understanding. Just recently in Bank Markazi
v. Peterson, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">578</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">___, ___–___ (2016) (slip op., at 19–
20), for example, the Court determined that cases “consol-
idated for administrative purposes at the execution stage
. . . were not independent of the original actions for dam-
ages and each claim retained its separate character.” The
Court quoted as authority a treatise explaining that “ac-
tions do not lose their separate identity because of consoli-
dation.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 20) (quoting 9A C. Wright
& A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure §2382, p. 10

dissenting), four dissenting Justices—reaching an issue
not addressed by the majority—cited Johnson for the
proposition that actions are “not merged” and do “not lose
their separate identities because of . . . consolidation”
under Rule 42(a).
   In the face of all the foregoing, we cannot accept Sam-
uel’s contention that “consolidate” in Rule 42(a) carried a
very different meaning—with very different consequences—
than it had in Johnson, just five years before the Rule
was adopted.
   None of this means that district courts may not consoli-
date cases for “all purposes” in appropriate circumstances.
District courts enjoy substantial discretion in deciding
whether and to what extent to consolidate cases. See 9A
Wright & Miller §2383 (collecting cases). What our deci-
sion does mean is that constituent cases retain their sepa-
rate identities at least to the extent that a final decision in
one is immediately appealable by the losing party. That
is, after all, the point at which, by definition, a “district
court disassociates itself from a case.” Swint v. Chambers
County Comm’n, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""117906""><a href=""/opinion/117906/swint-v-chambers-county-commn/""><span class=""volume"">514</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">35</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 42 (1995). We thus express
no view on any issue arising prior to that time.
                         *    *     *
   The normal rule is that a “final decision” confers upon
the losing party the immediate right to appeal. That rule
provides clear guidance to litigants. Creating exceptions

(slip op., at 15). If, as Samuel fears, our holding in this
case were to give rise to practical problems for district
courts and litigants, the appropriate Federal Rules Advi-
sory Committees would certainly remain free to take the
matter up and recommend revisions accordingly.
   Rule 42(a) did not purport to alter the settled under-
standing of the consequences of consolidation. That un-
derstanding makes clear that when one of several consoli-
dated cases is finally decided, a disappointed litigant is
free to seek review of that decision in the court of appeals.
   We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the
Third Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
                  THE THIRD CIRCUIT

   No. 16–1150. Argued January 16, 2018—Decided March 27, 2018
Respondent Samuel Hall served as caretaker and legal advisor to his
  mother Ethlyn Hall, a property owner in the United States Virgin Is-
  lands. After falling out with Samuel, Ethlyn transferred her property
  into a trust and designated her daughter, petitioner Elsa Hall, as her
  successor trustee. Ethlyn sued Samuel and his law firm over the
  handling of her affairs (the “trust case”). When Ethlyn died, Elsa
  took Ethlyn’s place as trustee and as plaintiff. Samuel later filed a
  separate complaint against Elsa in her individual capacity (the “indi-
  vidual case”).
     On Samuel’s motion, the District Court consolidated the trust and
  individual cases under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 42(a). The
  District Court held a single trial of the consolidated cases. In the in-
  dividual case, the jury returned a verdict for Samuel, but the District
  Court granted Elsa a new trial. In the trust case, the jury returned a
  verdict against Elsa, and she filed a notice of appeal from the judg-
  ment in that case. Samuel moved to dismiss the appeal on jurisdic-
  tional grounds, arguing that the judgment in the trust case was not
  final and appealable because his claims against Elsa remained unre-
  solved in the individual case. The Court of Appeals for the Third Cir-
  cuit agreed and dismissed the appeal.
Held: When one of several cases consolidated under Rule 42(a) is finally
 decided, that decision confers upon the losing party the immediate
 right to appeal, regardless of whether any of the other consolidated
 cases remain pending. Pp. 4–18.
    (a) Title 28 U. S. C. §1291 vests the courts of appeals with jurisdic-
2                              HALL v. HALL

                                  Syllabus

    tion over “appeals from all final decisions of the district courts,” ex-
    cept those directly appealable to this Court. Under §1291, “any liti-
    gant armed with a final judgment from a lower federal court is enti-
    tled to take an appeal.” Arizona v. Manypenny, 451 U. S. 232, 244.
    Here an appeal would normally lie from the judgment in the trust
    case. But Samuel argues that because the trust and individual cases
    were consolidated under Rule 42(a)(2), they merged and should be
    regarded as one case, such that the judgment in the trust case was
    merely interlocutory and not appealable before the consolidated cases
    in the aggregate are finally resolved. Pp. 4–5.
       (b) Rule 42(a)(2) provides that if “actions before the court involve a
    common question of law or fact, the court may . . . consolidate the ac-
    tions.” The meaning of the term “consolidate” in this context is am-
    biguous. But the term has a legal lineage stretching back at least to
    the first federal consolidation statute, enacted by Congress in 1813.
    Act of July 22, 1813, §3, 3 Stat. 21 (later codified as Rev. Stat. §921
    and 28 U. S. C. §734 (1934 ed.)). That history makes clear that one of
    multiple cases consolidated under the Rule retains its independent
    character, at least to the extent it is appealable when finally re-
    solved, regardless of any ongoing proceedings in the other cases.
    Pp. 5–6.
       (c) Under the consolidation statute—which was in force for 125
    years, until its replacement by Rule 42(a)—consolidation was under-
    stood not as completely merging the constituent cases into one, but as
    enabling more efficient case management while preserving the dis-
    tinct identities of the cases and rights of the separate parties in them.
    See, e.g., Rich v. Lambert, 12 How. 347; Mutual Life Ins. Co. v.
    Hillmon, 145 U. S. 285; Stone v. United States, 167 U. S. 178. Just
    five years before Rule 42(a) became law, the Court reiterated that,
    under the consolidation statute, consolidation did not result in the
    merger of constituent cases. Johnson v. Manhattan R. Co., 289 U. S.
    479, 496–497. This body of law supports the inference that, prior to
    Rule 42(a), a judgment completely resolving one of several consoli-
    dated cases was an immediately appealable final decision. Pp. 6–12.
       (d) Rule 42(a) was expressly modeled on the consolidation statute.
    Because the Rule contained no definition of “consolidate,” the term
    presumably carried forward the same meaning ascribed to it under
    the statute and reaffirmed in Johnson.
       Samuel nonetheless asserts that “consolidate” took on a different
    meaning under Rule 42(a). He describes the Rule as permitting two
    forms of consolidation: consolidation for limited purposes and consol-
    idation for all purposes. He locates textual authority for the former
    in a new provision, subsection (a)(1), which permits courts to “join for
    hearing or trial any or all matters at issue in the actions.” And he
                     Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)                     3

                                Syllabus

  contends that subsection (a)(2), so as not to be superfluous, must
  permit the merger of cases that have been consolidated for all pur-
  poses into a single, undifferentiated case. But the narrow grant of
  authority in subsection (a)(1) cannot fairly be read as the exclusive
  source of a district court’s power to consolidate cases for limited pur-
  poses, because there is much more to litigation than hearings or tri-
  als. Instead, that undisputed power must stem from subsection
  (a)(2). That defeats Samuel’s argument that interpreting subsection
  (a)(2) to adopt the traditional understanding of consolidation would
  render it duplicative of subsection (a)(1), and that subsection (a)(2)
  therefore must permit courts to merge the actions into a single unit.
     Moreover, a Federal Rules Advisory Committee would not take a
  term that had long meant that separate actions do not merge into
  one, and silently and abruptly reimagine the same term to mean that
  they do. Nothing in the pertinent Committee proceedings supports
  the notion that Rule 42(a) was meant to overturn the settled under-
  standing of consolidation; the Committee simply commented that
  Rule 42(a) “is based upon” its statutory predecessor, “but insofar as
  the statute differs from this rule, it is modified.” Advisory Commit-
  tee’s Notes on 1937 Adoption of Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 42(a), 28 U. S. C.
  App., p. 887. The limited extent to which this Court has addressed
  consolidation since adoption of Rule 42(a) confirms that the tradi-
  tional understanding remains in place. See, e.g., Bank Markazi v. Pe-
  terson, 578 U. S. ___, ___–___; Butler v. Dexter, 425 U. S. 262, 266–
  267.
     This decision does not mean that district courts may not consoli-
  date cases for all purposes in appropriate circumstances. But con-
  stituent cases retain their separate identities at least to the extent
  that a final decision in one is immediately appealable by the losing
  party. Pp. 12–17.

            APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT

                                [March 27, 2018]


  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
  Three Terms ago, we held that one of multiple cases
consolidated for multidistrict litigation under 28 U. S. C.
§1407 is immediately appealable upon an order disposing
of that case, regardless of whether any of the others re-
main pending. Gelboim v. Bank of America Corp., 574
U. S. ___ (2015). We left open, however, the question
whether the same is true with respect to cases consoli-
dated under Rule 42(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Proce-
dure. Id., at ___, n. 4 (slip op., at 7, n. 4). This case pre-
sents that question.
                            I
  Petitioner Elsa Hall and respondent Samuel Hall are
siblings enmeshed in a long-running family feud. Their
mother, Ethlyn Hall, lived and owned property in the
United States Virgin Islands. Samuel, a lawyer in the
Virgin Islands, served as Ethlyn’s caretaker and provided
her with legal assistance. But trouble eventually came to
2                      HALL v. HALL

                     Opinion of the Court

paradise, and Samuel and Ethlyn fell out over Samuel’s
management of Ethlyn’s real estate holdings. During a
visit from Elsa, Ethlyn established an inter vivos trust,
transferred all of her property into the trust, and desig-
nated Elsa as her successor trustee. Ethlyn then moved to
Miami—under circumstances disputed by the parties—to
live with her daughter.
   The family squabble made its way to court in May 2011.
Ethlyn, acting in her individual capacity and as trustee of
her inter vivos trust, sued Samuel and his law firm in
Federal District Court (the “trust case”).          Ethlyn’s
claims—for breach of fiduciary duty, legal malpractice,
conversion, fraud, and unjust enrichment—concerned the
handling of her affairs by Samuel and his law firm before
she left for Florida.
   Then Ethlyn died, and Elsa stepped into her shoes as
trustee and accordingly as plaintiff in the trust case.
Samuel promptly filed counterclaims in that case against
Elsa—in both her individual and representative capaci-
ties—for intentional infliction of emotional distress, fraud,
breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, and tortious inter-
ference. Samuel contended that Elsa had turned their
mother against him by taking advantage of Ethlyn’s alleged
mental frailty. But Samuel ran into an obstacle: Elsa was
not a party to the trust case in her individual capacity
(only Ethlyn had been). So Samuel filed a new complaint
against Elsa in her individual capacity in the same Dis-
trict Court (the “individual case”), raising the same claims
that he had asserted as counterclaims in the trust case.
   The trust and individual cases initially proceeded along
separate tracks. Eventually, on Samuel’s motion, the
District Court consolidated the cases under Rule 42(a) of
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, ordering that “[a]ll
submissions in the consolidated case shall be filed in” the
docket assigned to the trust case. App. to Pet. for Cert.
A–15.

                     Opinion of the Court

  Just before the trial commenced, the District Court
dismissed from the trust case Samuel’s counterclaims
against Elsa. Those claims remained in the individual
case. The parties then tried the consolidated cases to-
gether before a jury.
  In the individual case, the jury returned a verdict for
Samuel on his intentional infliction of emotional distress
claim against Elsa, awarding him $500,000 in compensa-
tory damages and $1.5 million in punitive damages. The
clerk entered judgment in that case, but the District Court
granted Elsa a new trial, which had the effect of reopening
the judgment. The individual case remains pending before
the District Court.
  In the trust case, the jury returned a verdict against
Elsa, in her representative capacity, on her claims against
Samuel and his law firm. The clerk entered judgment in
that case directing that Elsa “recover nothing” and that
“the action be dismissed on the merits.” Id., at A–12.
  Elsa filed a notice of appeal from the District Court’s
judgment in the trust case. Samuel and his law firm
moved to dismiss the appeal on jurisdictional grounds,
arguing that the judgment was not final and appealable
because his claims against Elsa remained unresolved in
the individual case. The Court of Appeals for the Third
Circuit agreed. When two cases have been consolidated
for all purposes, the court reasoned, a final decision on one
set of claims is generally not appealable while the second
set remains pending. The court explained that it consid-
ers “whether a less-than-complete judgment is appealable”
on a “case-by-case basis.” 679 Fed. Appx. 142, 145 (2017).
Here, the fact that the claims in the trust and individual
cases had been “scheduled together and tried before a
single jury” “counsel[ed] in favor of keeping the claims
together on appeal.” Ibid. The court dismissed Elsa’s
appeal for lack of jurisdiction.
  We granted certiorari, 582 U. S. ___ (2017), and now

   Had the District Court never consolidated the trust and
individual cases, there would be no question that Elsa
could immediately appeal from the judgment in the trust
case. Title 28 U. S. C. §1291 vests the courts of appeals
with jurisdiction over “appeals from all final decisions of
the district courts,” except those directly appealable to this
Court. A final decision “ends the litigation on the merits
and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the
judgment.” Ray Haluch Gravel Co. v. Central Pension
Fund of Operating Engineers and Participating Employ-
ers, 571 U. S. 177, 183 (2014). The archetypal final deci-
sion is “one[ ] that trigger[s] the entry of judgment.” Mo-
hawk Industries, Inc. v. Carpenter, 558 U. S. 100, 103
(2009). Appeal from such a final decision is a “matter of
right.” Gelboim, 574 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1). Under
§1291, “any litigant armed with a final judgment from a
lower federal court is entitled to take an appeal,” Arizona
v. Manypenny, 451 U. S. 232, 244 (1981), which generally
must be filed within 30 days, 28 U. S. C. §2107(a).
   Here the jury’s verdict against Elsa resolved all of the
claims in the trust case, and the clerk accordingly entered
judgment in that case providing that “the action be dis-
missed on the merits.” App. to Pet. for Cert. A–12. With
the entry of judgment, the District Court “completed its
adjudication of [Elsa’s] complaint and terminated [her]
action.” Gelboim, 574 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7). An
appeal would normally lie from that judgment.
   But, Samuel contends, there is more to the litigation
than the suit Elsa pursued against him in her representa-
tive capacity. There is also his suit against her in her
individual capacity, which has not yet been decided.
Because the District Court consolidated the trust and
                 Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)            5

                     Opinion of the Court

individual cases under Rule 42(a)(2), he argues, they
merged and should be regarded as one case. Viewed that
way, the judgment in the trust case was merely interlocu-
tory, and more remains to be done in the individual case
before the consolidated cases in the aggregate are finally
resolved and subject to appeal.
                               B
   Rule 42(a)—entitled “[c]onsolidation”—provides that if
“actions before the court involve a common question of law
or fact, the court may” take one of three measures. First,
the court may “join for hearing or trial any or all matters
at issue in the actions.” Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 42(a)(1).
Second, the court may “consolidate the actions.” Rule
42(a)(2). Third, the court may “issue any other orders to
avoid unnecessary cost or delay.” Rule 42(a)(3). Whether
the judgment entered in the trust case is an immediately
appealable final decision turns on the effect of consolida-
tion under Rule 42(a).
   Samuel, looking to dictionary definitions, asserts that
the “plain meaning of the phrase ‘consolidate the actions’
is . . . to unite two or more actions into one whole—that is,
to join them into a single case.” Brief for Respondents 23
(citing Black’s Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014); some inter-
nal quotation marks and alterations omitted). But the
meaning of “consolidate” in the present context is am-
biguous. When Rule 42(a) was adopted, the term was gener-
ally defined, as it is now, as meaning to “unite, as various
particulars, into one mass or body; to bring together in
close union; to combine.” Webster’s New International
Dictionary 570 (2d ed. 1942). Consolidation can thus
sometimes signify the complete merger of discrete units:
“The company consolidated two branches.” But the term
can also mean joining together discrete units without
causing them to lose their independent character. The
United States, for example, is composed of States
6                       HALL v. HALL

                      Opinion of the Court

“unite[d], as various particulars, into one mass or body,”
“br[ought] together in close union,” or “combine[d].” Yet
all agree that entry into our Union “by no means implies
the loss of distinct and individual existence . . . by the
States.” Texas v. White, 7 Wall. 700, 725 (1869). “She
consolidated her books” hardly suggests that the “books”
became “book.” The very metaphor Samuel offers—that
consolidation “make[s] two one, like marriage”—highlights
this point. Tr. of Oral Arg. 56. However dear to each
other, spouses would be surprised to hear that their union
extends beyond the metaphysical. This is not a plain
meaning case.
   It is instead about a term—consolidate—with a legal
lineage stretching back at least to the first federal consoli-
dation statute, enacted by Congress in 1813. Act of July
22, 1813, §3, 3 Stat. 21 (later codified as Rev. Stat. §921
and 28 U. S. C. §734 (1934 ed.)). Over 125 years, this
Court, along with the courts of appeals and leading trea-
tises, interpreted that term to mean the joining together—
but not the complete merger—of constituent cases. Those
authorities particularly emphasized that constituent cases
remained independent when it came to judgments and
appeals. Rule 42(a), promulgated in 1938, was expressly
based on the 1813 statute. The history against which Rule
42(a) was adopted resolves any ambiguity regarding the
meaning of “consolidate” in subsection (a)(2). It makes
clear that one of multiple cases consolidated under the
Rule retains its independent character, at least to the
extent it is appealable when finally resolved, regardless of
any ongoing proceedings in the other cases.
                           C
  Lord Mansfield pioneered the consolidation of related
cases in England, and the practice quickly took root in
American courts. See Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Hillmon, 145
U. S. 285, 292 (1892). In 1813, Congress authorized the

                      Opinion of the Court

newly formed federal courts, when confronted with “causes
of like nature, or relative to the same question,” to “make
such orders and rules concerning proceedings therein as
may be conformable to the principles and usages belonging
to courts for avoiding unnecessary costs or delay in the
administration of justice” and to “consolidate[]” the causes
when it “shall appear reasonable.” §3, 3 Stat. 21. This
consolidation statute applied at law, equity, and admi-
ralty, see 1 W. Rose, A Code of Federal Procedure §823(a)
(1907) (Rose), and remained in force for 125 years, until its
replacement by Rule 42(a).
   From the outset, we understood consolidation not as
completely merging the constituent cases into one, but
instead as enabling more efficient case management while
preserving the distinct identities of the cases and the
rights of the separate parties in them. In Rich v. Lambert,
12 How. 347 (1852), for example, we considered an appeal
from several consolidated cases in admiralty. The appel-
lees, the owners of cargo damaged during shipment, raised
a challenge to our jurisdiction that turned on the nature of
the consolidation. At the time, we could exercise appellate
jurisdiction only over cases involving at least $2,000 in
controversy. The damages awarded to the cargo owners in
the consolidated cases surpassed $2,000 in the aggregate,
but most of the constituent cases did not individually clear
that jurisdictional hurdle. Id., at 352–353.
   We declined to view the consolidated cases as one for
purposes of appeal, concluding that we had jurisdiction
only over those constituent cases that individually in-
volved damages exceeding $2,000. Ibid. As we explained,
“although [a consolidated] proceeding assumes the form of
a joint suit, it is in reality a mere joinder of distinct causes
of action by distinct parties, arising out of a common
injury, and which are heard and determined, so far as the
merits are concerned, the same as in the case of separate
libels for each cause of action.” Id., at 353. Consolidation
8                      HALL v. HALL

                     Opinion of the Court

was “allowed by the practice of the court for its conven-
ience, and the saving of time and expense to the parties.”
Ibid.
   The trial court’s decree, we noted, had the effect of
individually resolving each constituent case. Ibid. (“The
same decree . . . is entered as in the case of separate
suits.”); see Black’s Law Dictionary 532 (3d ed. 1933)
(“decree” is a “judgment of a court of equity or admiralty,
answering for most purposes to the judgment of a court of
common law”). Accordingly, we did “not perceive . . . any
ground for a distinction as to the right of appeal from a
decree as entered in these cases from that which exists
where the proceedings have been distinct and separate
throughout.” Rich, 12 How., at 353; see Hanover Fire Ins.
Co. v. Kinneard, 129 U. S. 176, 177 (1889) (evaluating
appellate jurisdiction over a writ of error in one of several
consolidated cases without reference to the others).
   We elaborated on the principles underlying consolida-
tion in Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Hillmon, 145 U. S.
285. Hillmon, a staple of law school courses on evidence,
involved three separate actions instituted against differ-
ent life insurance companies by one Sallie Hillmon, the
beneficiary on policies purchased by her husband John.
Sallie claimed she was entitled to the sizable proceeds of
the policies because John had died while journeying
through southern Kansas with two companions in search
of a site for a cattle ranch. The three companies countered
that John was in fact still alive, having conspired with one
of the companions to murder the other and pass his corpse
off as John’s, all as part of an insurance fraud scheme.
The trial court consolidated the cases and tried them
together. Id., at 285–287.
   The court, for purposes of determining the number of
peremptory juror challenges to which each defendant was
entitled, treated the three cases as though they had
merged into one. Ibid. On appeal we disagreed, holding

                     Opinion of the Court

that each defendant should receive the full complement of
peremptory challenges. Id., at 293. That was because,
“although the defendants might lawfully be compelled, at
the discretion of the court, to try the cases together, the
causes of action remained distinct, and required separate
verdicts and judgments; and no defendant could be de-
prived, without its consent, of any right material to its
defence . . . to which it would have been entitled if the
cases had been tried separately.” Ibid. On remand, one
case settled, and a consolidated trial of the others “re-
sult[ed] in separate judgments” for Sallie. Connecticut
Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Hillmon, 188 U. S. 208, 209 (1903).
   In Stone v. United States, 167 U. S. 178, 189 (1897), we
held that a party appealing from the judgment in one of
two cases consolidated for trial could not also raise claims
with respect to the other case. John Stone was the sole
defendant in one case and one of three defendants in the
other. Id., at 179–181. After a consolidated trial, the jury
returned a verdict in the case against Stone alone; its
verdict in the multidefendant case was set aside. Id., at
181. Stone appealed from the judgment in his case, argu-
ing that the failure to grant a peremptory challenge in the
multidefendant case affected the jury’s verdict in his. Id.,
at 189. We rejected that claim, punctiliously respecting
the distinction between the constituent cases. There was
“no merit in the objection,” we said, because in the case
before us Stone had “had the benefit of the three peremp-
tory challenges” to which he was entitled in that case.
Ibid.; see Stone v. United States, 64 F. 667, 672 (CA9 1894)
(“The two cases, although consolidated, were separate and
distinct. Defendant had exercised all the rights and privi-
leges he was entitled to in this case.”).
   And just five years before Rule 42(a) became law, we
reiterated that, under the consolidation statute, consolida-
tion did not result in the merger of constituent cases.

10                           HALL v. HALL

                          Opinion of the Court

(1933). A major case of its day, Johnson arose from the
“financial embarrassment” during the Great Depression of
two companies involved in operating the New York sub-
way system. Johnson v. Manhattan R. Co., 61 F. 2d 934,
936 (CA2 1932). In the resulting litigation, the District
Court consolidated two suits, apparently with the intent to
“effect an intervention of the parties to the [first suit] in
the [second] suit”—in other words, to make the two suits
one. Id., at 940. Judge Learned Hand, writing for the
Second Circuit on appeal, would have none of it: “consoli-
dation does not merge the suits; it is a mere matter of
convenience in administration, to keep them in step. They
remain as independent as before.” Ibid. We affirmed,
relying on Hillmon and several lower court cases reflecting
the same understanding of consolidation. Johnson, 289
U. S., at 497, n. 8. We explained once more that “consoli-
dation is permitted as a matter of convenience and econ-
omy in administration, but does not merge the suits into a
single cause, or change the rights of the parties, or make
those who are parties in one suit parties in another.” Id.,
at 496–497.
   Decisions by the Courts of Appeals, with isolated depar-
tures,* reflected the same understanding in cases involv-
ing all manners of consolidation. See, e.g., Baltimore S. S.
Co., Inc. v. Koppel Indus. Car & Equip. Co., 299 F. 158,
160 (CA4 1924) (“the consolidation for convenience of trial
did not merge the two causes of action” or “deprive either

   * See, e.g., Edward P. Allis Co. v. Columbia Mill Co., 65 F. 52, 54
(CA8 1894) (involving two suits “consolidated, and tried as one action,”
with the “complaint in the first suit . . . treated as a counterclaim
interposed in the second suit”). State practice was varied. Compare,
e.g., East Bay Municipal Util. Dist. v. Kieffer, 99 Cal. App. 240, 263
(1929) (denial of rehearing) (“By such consolidation the three proceed-
ings became one proceeding and should have been determined by a
single verdict, ‘a single set of findings and a single judgment.’ ”), with
Missouri Pac. R. Co. v. Helmert, 196 Ark. 1073, 121 S. W. 2d 103 (1938)
(consolidated cases resulted in separate judgments).

party of any right or relieve it of any burden incident to
the libel or cross-libel as a separate proceeding”); Taylor v.
Logan Trust Co., 289 F. 51, 53 (CA8 1923) (parties to one
constituent case could not appeal orders in the other be-
cause “consolidation did not make the parties to one suit
parties to the other”; cited in Johnson); Toledo, St. L. & K.
C. R. Co. v. Continental Trust Co., 95 F. 497, 506 (CA6
1899) (consolidation “operates as a mere carrying on to-
gether of two separate suits supposed to involve identical
issues” and “does not avoid the necessity of separate de-
crees in each case”; cited in Johnson).
   One frequently cited case illustrates the point. In Adler
v. Seaman, 266 F. 828, 831 (CA8 1920), the District Court
“sought to employ consolidation as a medium of getting
the two independent suits united,” but the Court of Ap-
peals made clear that the consolidation statute did not
authorize such action. The court explained that constitu-
ent cases sometimes “assume certain natural attitudes
toward each other, such as ‘in the nature of ’ a cross-bill or
intervention.” Id., at 838. Be that as it may, the court
continued, “this is purely a rule of convenience, and does
not result in actually making such parties defendants or
interveners in the other suit.” Ibid. The court described
“the result of consolidation” as instead “merely to try cases
together, necessitating separate verdicts and judgments or
separate decrees,” and to “leave” the constituent cases
“separate, independent action[s].” Id., at 838, 840.
   Treatises summarizing federal precedent applying the
consolidation statute also concluded that consolidated
cases “remain distinct.” 1 Rose §823(c), at 758. They
recognized that consolidated cases should “remain sepa-
rate as to parties, pleadings, and judgment,” W. Simkins,
Federal Practice 63 (rev. ed. 1923), and that “[t]here must
be separate verdicts, judgments or decrees, even although
the consolidating party wished for one verdict,” 1 Rose
§823(c), at 758; see also G. Virden, Consolidation Under
12                     HALL v. HALL

                     Opinion of the Court

Rule 42 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, in 141
F. R. D. 169, 173–174 (1992) (Virden) (“as of 1933 and the
Johnson case of that year, it was well settled that consoli-
dation in the federal courts did not merge the separate
cases into a single action”).
   Several aspects of this body of law support the inference
that, prior to Rule 42(a), a judgment completely resolving
one of several consolidated cases was an immediately
appealable final decision. We made clear, for example,
that each constituent case must be analyzed individually
on appeal to ascertain jurisdiction and to decide its dispo-
sition—a compartmentalized analysis that would be gratu-
itous if the cases had merged into a single case subject to a
single appeal. We emphasized that constituent cases
should end in separate decrees or judgments—the tradi-
tional trigger for the right to appeal, for which there would
be no need if an appeal could arise only from the resolu-
tion of the consolidated cases as a whole. We explained
that the parties to one case did not become parties to the
other by virtue of consolidation—indicating that the right
of each to pursue his individual case on appeal should not
be compromised by the litigation conduct of the other.
And, finally, we held that consolidation could not prejudice
rights to which the parties would have been due had
consolidation never occurred. Forcing an aggrieved party
to wait for other cases to conclude would substantially
impair his ability to appeal from a final decision fully
resolving his own case—a “matter of right,” Gelboim, 574
U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1), to which he was “entitled,”
Manypenny, 451 U. S., at 244.
                           D
  Against this background, two years after Johnson, the
Rules Advisory Committee began discussion of what was
to become Rule 42(a). The Rule, which became effective in
1938, was expressly modeled on its statutory predecessor,
                  Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)           13

                      Opinion of the Court

the Act of July 22, 1813. See Advisory Committee’s Notes
on 1937 Adoption of Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 42(a), 28 U. S. C.
App., p. 887. The Rule contained no definition of “consoli-
date,” so the term presumably carried forward the same
meaning we had ascribed to it under the consolidation
statute for 125 years, and had just recently reaffirmed in
Johnson. See Frankfurter, Some Reflections on the Read-
ing of Statutes, 47 Colum. L. Rev. 527, 537 (1947) (“if a
word is obviously transplanted from another legal source,
whether the common law or other legislation, it brings the
old soil with it”); cf. Class v. United States, 583 U. S. ___,
___ (2018) (slip op., at 10) (Federal Rule of Criminal Pro-
cedure 11(a)(2) did not silently alter existing doctrine
established by this Court’s past decisions).
  Samuel nonetheless asserts that there is a significant
distinction between the original consolidation statute and
Rule 42(a). The statute authorized district courts to “con-
solidate” related “causes when it appears reasonable to do
so” or to “make such orders and rules . . . as may be con-
formable to the usages of courts for avoiding unnecessary
costs or delay in the administration of justice.” 28 U. S. C.
§734 (1934 ed.). Rule 42(a) permits district courts not only
to “consolidate the actions” (subsection (a)(2)) and “issue
any other orders to avoid unnecessary cost or delay” (sub-
section (a)(3)), but also to “join for hearing or trial any or
all matters at issue in the actions” (subsection (a)(1)).
  Whatever “consolidate” meant under the statute, Sam-
uel posits, it took on a different meaning under Rule 42(a)
with the addition of subsection (a)(1). Samuel describes
the Rule as “permit[ting] two forms of consolidation”:
consolidation that “extend[s] only to certain proceedings,”
such as discovery, and consolidation “for all purposes.”
Brief for Respondents 4–5. He locates textual authority
for the former in subsection (a)(1), which he says empow-
ers courts to “join[ ] multiple actions for procedural pur-
poses.” Id., at 23. In light of this broad grant of authority,
14                      HALL v. HALL

                      Opinion of the Court

he contends, subsection (a)(2) must provide for something
more if it is not to be superfluous. And Samuel sees that
something more as the ability to merge cases that have
been consolidated for “all purposes” into a single, undiffer-
entiated case—one appealable only when all issues in each
formerly distinct case have been decided. See id., at 22–24
(to “consolidate” separate actions is “to join them into a
single case” or “meld [them] into a single unit” (alterations
omitted)).
   We disagree. It is only by substantially overreading
subsection (a)(1) that Samuel can argue that its addition
compels a radical reinterpretation of the familiar term
“consolidate” in subsection (a)(2). The text of subsection
(a)(1) permits the joining of cases only for “hearing or
trial.” That narrow grant of authority cannot fairly be
read as the exclusive source of a district court’s power to
“join[ ] multiple actions for procedural purposes.” Brief for
Respondents 23. There is, after all, much more to litiga-
tion than hearings or trials—such as motions practice or
discovery. A district court’s undisputed ability to consoli-
date cases for such limited purposes must therefore stem
from subsection (a)(2). That defeats Samuel’s argument
that interpreting subsection (a)(2) to adopt the traditional
understanding of consolidation would render it “wholly
duplicative of [subsection] (a)(1),” and that subsection
(a)(2) “therefore must permit courts . . . to ‘consolidate’ the
actions themselves into a single unit.” Id., at 23–24.
Samuel’s reinterpretation of “consolidate” is, in other
words, a solution in search of a problem.
   We think, moreover, that if Rule 42(a) were meant to
transform consolidation into something sharply contrary
to what it had been, we would have heard about it. Con-
gress, we have held, “does not alter the fundamental
details” of an existing scheme with “vague terms” and
“subtle device[s].” Whitman v. American Trucking Assns.,
Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 468 (2001); cf. Class, 583 U. S., at ___

                     Opinion of the Court

(slip op., at 10). That is true in spades when it comes to
the work of the Federal Rules Advisory Committees.
Their laborious drafting process requires years of effort
and many layers of careful review before a proposed Rule
is presented to this Court for possible submission to Con-
gress. See Report of Advisory Committee on Rules for
Civil Procedure (Apr. 1937) (describing the exhaustive
process undertaken to draft the first Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure). No sensible draftsman, let alone a Federal
Rules Advisory Committee, would take a term that had
meant, for more than a century, that separate actions do
not merge into one, and silently and abruptly reimagine
the same term to mean that they do.
    Similarly, nothing in the pertinent proceedings of the
Rules Advisory Committee supports the notion that Rule
42(a) was meant to overturn the settled understanding of
consolidation. See United States v. Vonn, 535 U. S. 55, 64,
n. 6 (2002) (Advisory Committee Notes are “a reliable
source of insight into the meaning of a rule”). In this
instance, the Committee simply commented that Rule
42(a) “is based upon” its statutory predecessor, “but inso-
far as the statute differs from this rule, it is modified.”
Advisory Committee’s Notes on 1937 Adoption of Fed.
Rule Civ. Proc. 42(a), 28 U. S. C. App., at 887. The Com-
mittee did not identify any specific instance in which Rule
42(a) changed the statute, let alone the dramatic trans-
formation Samuel would have us recognize. See Virden
174–181 (evaluating the history of the development of
Rule 42(a) and finding no evidence that the Committee
intended a shift in meaning along the lines proposed by
Samuel). This is significant because when the Committee
intended a new rule to change existing federal practice, it
typically explained the departure. See, e.g., Advisory
Committee’s Notes on 1937 Adoption of Fed. Rule Civ.
Proc. 4, 28 U. S. C. App., p. 747 (a predecessor statute “is
substantially continued insofar as it applies to a sum-
16                     HALL v. HALL

                     Opinion of the Court

mons, but its requirements as to teste of process are su-
perseded”); Advisory Committee’s Notes on 1937 Adoption
of Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 18, 28 U. S. C. App., p. 802 (“In
respect to fraudulent conveyances the rule changes the
former rule requiring a prior judgment against the owner
. . . to conform to the provisions of the Uniform Fraudulent
Conveyance Act, §§ 9 and 10.”).
    As a leading treatise explained at the time, through
consolidation under Rule 42(a) “one or many or all of the
phases of the several actions may be merged. But merger
is never so complete in consolidation as to deprive any
party of any substantial rights which he may have pos-
sessed had the actions proceeded separately.” 3 J. Moore
& J. Friedman, Moore’s Federal Practice §42.01, pp. 3050–
3051 (1938). Thus, “separate verdicts and judgments are
normally necessary.” Id., at 3051, n. 12.
    The limited extent to which this Court has addressed
consolidation since adoption of Rule 42(a) confirms the
traditional understanding. Just recently in Bank Markazi
v. Peterson, 578 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2016) (slip op., at 19–
20), for example, the Court determined that cases “consol-
idated for administrative purposes at the execution stage
. . . were not independent of the original actions for dam-
ages and each claim retained its separate character.” The
Court quoted as authority a treatise explaining that “ac-
tions do not lose their separate identity because of consoli-
dation.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 20) (quoting 9A C. Wright
& A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure §2382, p. 10
(3d ed. 2008) (Wright & Miller)).
    In Butler v. Dexter, 425 U. S. 262, 266–267 (1976) (per
curiam), we dismissed an appeal because the constitutional
question that supplied our jurisdiction had been raised
not in the case before us, but instead only in other cases
with which it had been consolidated. We explained that
“[e]ach case . . . must be considered separately to deter-
mine whether or not this Court has jurisdiction to consider
                  Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)            17

                      Opinion of the Court

its merits”. Id., at 267, n. 12; see Rich, 12 How., at 352–
353. And in Alfred Dunhill of London, Inc. v. Republic of
Cuba, 425 U. S. 682, 735, and n. 22 (1976) (Marshall, J.,
dissenting), four dissenting Justices—reaching an issue
not addressed by the majority—cited Johnson for the
proposition that actions are “not merged” and do “not lose
their separate identities because of . . . consolidation”
under Rule 42(a).
   In the face of all the foregoing, we cannot accept Sam-
uel’s contention that “consolidate” in Rule 42(a) carried a
very different meaning—with very different consequences—
than it had in Johnson, just five years before the Rule
was adopted.
   None of this means that district courts may not consoli-
date cases for “all purposes” in appropriate circumstances.
District courts enjoy substantial discretion in deciding
whether and to what extent to consolidate cases. See 9A
Wright & Miller §2383 (collecting cases). What our deci-
sion does mean is that constituent cases retain their sepa-
rate identities at least to the extent that a final decision in
one is immediately appealable by the losing party. That
is, after all, the point at which, by definition, a “district
court disassociates itself from a case.” Swint v. Chambers
County Comm’n, 514 U. S. 35, 42 (1995). We thus express
no view on any issue arising prior to that time.
                         *    *     *
   The normal rule is that a “final decision” confers upon
the losing party the immediate right to appeal. That rule
provides clear guidance to litigants. Creating exceptions
to such a critical step in litigation should not be under-
taken lightly. Congress has granted us the authority to pre-
scribe rules “defin[ing] when a ruling of a district court is
final for the purposes of appeal under” §1291, 28 U. S. C.
§2072(c), and we have explained that changes with respect
to the meaning of final decision “are to come from rule-
18                      HALL v. HALL

making, . . . not judicial decisions in particular controver-
sies,” Microsoft Corp. v. Baker, 582 U. S. ___, ___ (2017)
(slip op., at 15). If, as Samuel fears, our holding in this
case were to give rise to practical problems for district
courts and litigants, the appropriate Federal Rules Advi-
sory Committees would certainly remain free to take the
matter up and recommend revisions accordingly.
   Rule 42(a) did not purport to alter the settled under-
standing of the consequences of consolidation. That un-
derstanding makes clear that when one of several consoli-
dated cases is finally decided, a disappointed litigant is
free to seek review of that decision in the court of appeals.
   We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the
Third Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.
                                              It is so ordered.

    CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS DIVISION


CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT

   No. 16–6795. Argued October 30, 2017—Decided March 21, 2018
Petitioner Ayestas was convicted of murder and sentenced to death in a
  Texas state court. He secured new counsel, but his conviction and
  sentence were affirmed on appeal. A third legal team sought, unsuc-
  cessfully, state habeas relief, claiming trial-level ineffective assis-
  tance of counsel but not counsel’s failure to investigate petitioner’s
  mental health and alcohol and drug abuse during the trial’s penalty
  phase. His fourth set of attorneys did raise that failure in a federal
  habeas petition, but because the claim had never been raised in state
  court, the District Court held, it was barred by procedural default.
  That decision was vacated and remanded for reconsideration in light
  of Martinez v. Ryan, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">566</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">1</span></span><pre class=""inline"">—where this Court held that an Ari-

  showing that the claim is substantial and that state habeas counsel
  was also ineffective in failing to raise the claim in a state habeas pro-
  ceeding—and Trevino v. Thaler, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">569</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">413</span></span><pre class=""inline"">—which extended that

  §3599(f), which provides, in relevant part, that a district court “may
  authorize” funding for “investigative, expert, or other services . . .
  reasonably necessary for the representation of the defendant.” The
  court found his claim precluded by procedural default and thus de-
  nied his funding request. The Fifth Circuit also rejected the funding

Held:
    1. The District Court’s denial of petitioner’s funding request was a
 judicial decision subject to appellate review under the standard juris-
 dictional provisions. Pp. 7–14.
       (a) Title </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">28</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §§1291, 2253, and 1254 confer jurisdiction to
 review decisions made by a district court in a judicial capacity. “Ad-
 ministrative” decisions—about, e.g., facilities, personnel, equipment,
 supplies, and rules of procedure—are “not subject to [this Court’s] re-
 view,” Hohn v. United States, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""118230""><a href=""/opinion/118230/hohn-v-united-states/""><span class=""volume"">524</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">236</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 245, but the District
 Court’s ruling here does not remotely resemble such decisions. Peti-
 tioner’s request was made by motion in his federal habeas proceed-
 ing, which is indisputably a judicial proceeding. And resolution of
 the funding question requires the application of a legal standard—
 whether the funding is “reasonably necessary” for effective represen-
 tation—that demands an evaluation of petitioner’s prospects of ob-
 taining habeas relief. Pp. 8–10.
       (b) Respondent’s arguments in support of her claim that §3599’s
 funding requests are nonadversarial and administrative are unper-
 suasive. First, that the requests can be decided ex parte does not
 make the proceeding nonadversarial. The habeas proceeding here
 was clearly adversarial. And petitioner and respondent plainly have
 adverse interests on the funding question and have therefore squared
 off as adversaries. The mere fact that a §3599 funding request may
 sometimes be made ex parte is thus hardly dispositive. Second, noth-
 ing in §3599 even hints that the funding decisions may be revised by
 the Director of the Administrative Office of the Courts. Lower court
 cases that appear to have accepted Administrative Office review of
 certain Criminal Justice Act (CJA) payments, even if a proper inter-
 pretation of the CJA, are inapposite.           Finally, the fact that
 §3599(g)(2) requires funding in excess of the generally applicable
 statutory cap to be approved by the circuit’s chief judge or another
 designated circuit judge, instead of by a panel of three, does not make
 the proceeding administrative. If Congress wishes to make certain
 rulings reviewable by a single circuit judge, the Constitution does not
 stand in the way. Pp. 10–14.
    2. The Fifth Circuit did not apply the correct legal standard in af-
 firming the denial of petitioner’s funding request. Section 3599 au-
 thorizes funding for the “reasonably necessary” services of experts,
 investigators, and the like. But the Fifth Circuit’s requirement that
 applicants show a “substantial need” for the services is arguably a
 more demanding standard. Section 3599 appears to use the term

                                Syllabus

  “necessary” to mean something less than essential. Because it makes
  little sense to refer to something as being “reasonably essential,” the
  Court concludes that the statutory phrase calls for the district court
  to determine, in its discretion, whether a reasonable attorney would
  regard the services as sufficiently important, guided by considera-
  tions detailed in the opinion. The term “substantial” in the Fifth Cir-
  cuit’s test, however, suggests a heavier burden. And that court exac-
  erbated the difference by also requiring a funding applicant to
  present “a viable constitutional claim that is not procedurally
  barred.” That rule that is too restrictive after Trevino, see 569 U. S.
  at 429, because, in cases where funding stands a credible chance of
  enabling a habeas petitioner to overcome the procedural default ob-
  stacle, it may be error for a district court to refuse funding. That be-
  ing said, district courts were given broad discretion in assessing fund-
  ing requests when Congress changed the phrase “shall authorize” in
  §3599’s predecessor statute, see </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">21</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §848(q)(9), to “may au-
  thorize” in §3599(f). A funding applicant must not be expected to
  prove that he will be able to win relief if given the services, but the
  “reasonably necessary” test does require an assessment of the likely
  utility of the services requested.
     Respondent’s alternative ground for affirmance—that funding is
  never “reasonably necessary” where a habeas petitioner seeks to pre-
  sent a procedurally defaulted ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel
  claim that depends on facts outside the state-court record—remains
  open for the Fifth Circuit to consider on remand. Pp. 14–19.

 COREA, PETITIONER v. LORIE DAVIS, DIRECTOR, 

  TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE, 

    CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS DIVISION

 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT

                               [March 21, 2018]


  JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.
  Petitioner Carlos Ayestas, who was convicted of murder
and sentenced to death in a Texas court, argues that he
was wrongfully denied funding for investigative services
needed to prove his entitlement to federal habeas relief.
Petitioner moved for funding under </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">18</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §3599(f ),
which makes funds available if they are “reasonably nec-
essary,” but petitioner’s motion was denied. We hold that
the lower courts applied the wrong legal standard, and we
therefore vacate the judgment below and remand for
further proceedings.
                              I

                              A

  In 1997, petitioner was convicted of capital murder in a
Texas court. Evidence at trial showed that he and two
accomplices invaded the home of a 67-year-old Houston
woman, Santiaga Paneque, bound her with duct tape and
electrical cord, beat and strangled her, and then made off
with a stash of her belongings.
2                    AYESTAS v. DAVIS

                     Opinion of the Court

   The jury also heard testimony from Henry Nuila regard-
ing an incident that occurred about two weeks after the
murder. Petitioner was drunk at the time, and he re-
vealed to Nuila that he had recently murdered a woman in
Houston. Petitioner then brandished an Uzi machinegun
and threatened to murder Nuila if he did not help peti-
tioner kill his two accomplices. Fortunately for Nuila,
petitioner kept talking until he eventually passed out;
Nuila then called the police, who arrested petitioner, still
in possession of the gun.
   After the jury found petitioner guilty, it was asked to
determine whether he should be sentenced to death or to
life in prison. In order to impose a death sentence, Texas
law required the jury to answer the following three ques-
tions. First, would petitioner pose a continuing threat to
society? Second, had he personally caused the death of the
victim, intended to kill her, or anticipated that she would
be killed? Third, in light of all the evidence surrounding
the crime and petitioner’s background, were there suffi-
cient mitigating circumstances to warrant a sentence of
life without parole instead of death? Tex. Code Crim.
Proc. Ann., Art. 37.071, §§2(b), (e) (Vernon Cum. Supp.
2017). Only if the jury gave a unanimous yes to the first
two questions, and a unanimous no to the third question,
could a death sentence be imposed; otherwise, petitioner
would receive a sentence of life without parole. See
§§2(d)(2), (f )(2), (g).
   In asking the jury to impose a death sentence, the pros-
ecution supplemented the trial record with evidence of
petitioner’s criminal record and his encounter with a man
named Candelario Martinez a few days after the murder.
Martinez told the jury that he was standing in a hotel
parking lot waiting for a friend when petitioner ap-
proached and began to make small talk. Before long,
petitioner pulled out a machinegun and forced Martinez
into a room where two of petitioner’s compatriots were

                      Opinion of the Court

holding Martinez’s friend at knifepoint. Ordered to lie
down on the bathroom floor and await his execution,
Martinez begged for his life while petitioner and his co-
horts haggled about who would carry out the killing.
Finally, petitioner relented, but he threatened to kill
Martinez and his family if he contacted the police. Peti-
tioner then stole Martinez’s truck.
   Petitioner’s trial counsel presented very little mitigation
evidence. This was due, at least in part, to petitioner’s
steadfast refusal for many months to allow his lawyers to
contact his family members, who were living in Honduras
and might have testified about his character and upbring-
ing. Petitioner gave in on the eve of trial, and at that
point, according to the state habeas courts, his lawyers
“made every effort to contact [his] family.” App. 171.
They repeatedly contacted petitioner’s family members
and urged them to attend the trial; they requested that
the U. S. Embassy in Honduras facilitate family members’
travel to the United States; and they met in person with
the Honduran Consulate to seek assistance. But these
efforts were to no avail. Petitioner’s sister told his legal
team that the family would not leave Honduras because
the journey would create economic hardship and because
their father was ill and had killed one of their neighbors.
A defense attorney who spoke to petitioner’s mother testi-
fied that she seemed unconcerned about her son’s situa-
tion. In general, the state habeas courts found, petitioner
“did nothing to assist counsel’s efforts to contact his family
and did not want them contacted by the consulate or
counsel.” Id., at 174.
   In the end, the only mitigation evidence introduced by
petitioner’s trial counsel consisted of three letters from
petitioner’s English instructor. The letters, each two
sentences long, described petitioner as “a serious and
attentive student who is progressing well in English.”

                     Opinion of the Court

  The jury unanimously concluded that petitioner should
be sentenced to death, and a capital sentence was im-
posed. Petitioner secured new counsel to handle his ap-
peal, and his conviction and sentence were affirmed by the
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals in 1998. Ayestas v.
State, No. 72,928, App. 115. Petitioner did not seek review
at that time from this Court.
                              B
   While petitioner’s direct appeal was still pending, a
third legal team filed a habeas petition on his behalf in
state court. This petition included several claims of trial-
level ineffective assistance of counsel, but the petition did
not assert that trial counsel were ineffective for failing to
investigate petitioner’s mental health and abuse of alcohol
and drugs. Petitioner’s quest for state habeas relief ended
unsuccessfully in 2008. Ex parte Ayestas, No. WR–69,674–
01 (Tex. Ct. Crim. App., Sept. 10, 2008), </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">2008</span> <span class=""reporter"">WL</span> <span class=""page"">4151814</span></span><pre class=""inline"">
(per curiam) (unpublished).
   In 2009, represented by a fourth set of attorneys, peti-
tioner filed a federal habeas petition under </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">28</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">.
§2254, and this time he did allege that his right to the
effective assistance of counsel at trial was violated because
his attorneys failed to conduct an adequate search for
mitigation evidence. As relevant here, petitioner argued
that trial counsel overlooked evidence that he was mentally
ill and had a history of drug and alcohol abuse. Ayestas
v. Thaler, Civ. Action No. H–09–2999 (SD Tex., Jan. 26,
2011), </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">2011</span> <span class=""reporter"">WL</span> <span class=""page"">285138</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, *4. Petitioner alleged that he had
a history of substance abuse, and he noted that he had
been diagnosed with schizophrenia while the state habeas
proceeding was still pending. See Pet. for Writ of Habeas
Corpus in Ayestas v. Quarterman, No. 4:09–cv–2999 (SD
Tex.), Doc. 1, pp. 21–23. Petitioner claimed that trial
counsel’s deficient performance caused prejudice because
there was a reasonable chance that an adequate investiga-
                 Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)            5

                     Opinion of the Court

tion would have produced mitigation evidence that would
have persuaded the jury to spare his life.
   Among the obstacles standing between petitioner and
federal habeas relief, however, was the fact that he never
raised this trial-level ineffective-assistance-of-counsel
claim in state court. The District Court therefore held
that the claim was barred by procedural default, Ayestas v.
Thaler, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">2011</span> <span class=""reporter"">WL</span> <span class=""page"">285138</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, *4–*7, and the Fifth Circuit
affirmed, Ayestas v. Thaler, 462 Fed. Appx. 474, 482
(2012) (per curiam).
   Petitioner sought review in this Court, and we vacated
the decision below and remanded for reconsideration in
light of two of our subsequent decisions, Martinez v. Ryan,
</pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">566</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">1</span></span><pre class=""inline""> (2012), and Trevino v. Thaler, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">569</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">413</span></span><pre class=""inline"">
(2013). Ayestas v. Thaler, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">569</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">1015</span></span><pre class=""inline""> (2013). Martinez
held that an Arizona prisoner seeking federal habeas relief
could overcome the procedural default of a trial-level
ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim by showing that the
claim is substantial and that state habeas counsel was
also ineffective in failing to raise the claim in a state
habeas proceeding. 566 U. S., at 14. Trevino extended
that holding to Texas prisoners, 569 U. S., at 416–417, and
on remand, petitioner argued that he fell within Trevino
because effective state habeas counsel would have uncov-
ered evidence showing that trial counsels’ investigative
efforts were deficient.
   To assist in developing these claims, petitioner filed an
ex parte motion asking the District Court for $20,016 in
funding to conduct a search for evidence supporting his
petition. He relied on </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">18</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §3599(f ), which provides
in relevant part as follows:
       “Upon a finding that investigative, expert, or other
    services are reasonably necessary for the representa-
    tion of the defendant, whether in connection with is-
    sues relating to guilt or the sentence, the court may
6                    AYESTAS v. DAVIS

                     Opinion of the Court

    authorize the defendant’s attorneys to obtain such
    services on behalf of the defendant and, if so author-
    ized, shall order the payment of fees and expenses
    therefor.”
Petitioner averred that the funds would be used to conduct
an investigation that would show that his trial counsel
and his state habeas counsel were ineffective. Accordingly,
he claimed, the investigation would establish both that
his trial-level ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim was
not barred by procedural default and that he was entitled
to resentencing based on the denial of his Sixth Amend-
ment right to the effective assistance of trial counsel.
   The District Court refused the funding request and
ultimately denied petitioner’s habeas petition. Ayestas v.
Stephens, Civ. Action No. H–09–2999, (SD Tex., Nov. 18,
2014), </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">2014</span> <span class=""reporter"">WL</span> <span class=""page"">6606498</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, *6–*7. On the merits of peti-
tioner’s new ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim,
the District Court held that petitioner failed both prongs
of the Strickland test. See Strickland v. Washington, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""111170""><a href=""/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/""><span class=""volume"">466</span>
<span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">668</span></a></span><pre class=""inline""> (1984). Noting that most of the evidence bearing
on petitioner’s mental health had emerged only after he
was sentenced, the court concluded that petitioner’s trial
lawyers were not deficient in failing to find such evidence
in time for the sentencing proceeding. </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">2014</span> <span class=""reporter"">WL</span> <span class=""page"">6606498</span></span><pre class=""inline"">,
*5. In addition, the court found that state habeas counsel
did not render deficient performance by failing to investi-
gate petitioner’s history of substance abuse, and that, in
any event, petitioner was not prejudiced at the sentencing
phase of the trial or during the state habeas proceedings
because the potential mitigation evidence at issue would
not have made a difference to the jury in light of “the
extremely brutal nature of [the] crime and [petitioner’s]
history of criminal violence.” Ibid.
   With respect to funding, the District Court pointed to
Fifth Circuit case law holding that a §3599(f ) funding
                     Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)                  7

                         Opinion of the Court

applicant cannot show that investigative services are
“ ‘reasonably necessary’ ” unless the applicant can show
that he has a “ ‘substantial need’ ” for those services. Id.,
at *6. In addition, the court noted that “[t]he Fifth Circuit
upholds the denial of funding” when, among other things,
“a petitioner has . . . failed to supplement his funding
request with a viable constitutional claim that is not
procedurally barred.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks
omitted).
    Given its holding that petitioner’s new ineffective-
assistance-of-counsel claim was precluded by procedural
default, this rule also doomed his request for funding. The
District Court denied petitioner’s habeas petition and
refused to grant him a certificate of appealability (COA).
Id., at *7. On appeal, the Fifth Circuit held that a COA
was not needed for review of the funding issue, but it
rejected that claim for essentially the same reasons as the
District Court, citing both the “substantial need” test and
the rule that funding may be denied when a funding appli-
cant fails to present “a viable constitutional claim that is
not procedurally barred.” Ayestas v. Stephens, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">817</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.3d</span>
<span class=""page"">888</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 895–896 (2016) (internal quotation marks omitted).
With respect to petitioner’s other claims, including his
claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, the Fifth
Circuit refused to issue a COA. Id., at 898.
                             C
  We granted certiorari to decide whether the lower courts
applied the correct legal standard in denying the funding
request. 581 U. S. ___ (2017).
                            II
  Before we reach that question, however, we must con-
sider a jurisdictional argument advanced by respondent,
the Director of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.1
——————
 1 We   also consider a jurisdictional issue not raised by the parties,
8                        AYESTAS v. DAVIS

                         Opinion of the Court

Respondent contends that the District Court’s denial of
petitioner’s funding request was an administrative, not a
judicial, decision and therefore falls outside the scope of
the jurisdictional provisions on which petitioner relied in
seeking review in the Court of Appeals and in this Court.
                           A
  When the District Court denied petitioner’s funding
request and his habeas petition, he took an appeal to the
——————
namely, whether we have jurisdiction even though no COA has yet
been issued. We do not have jurisdiction if jurisdiction was lacking in
the Court of Appeals, and the jurisdiction of a court of appeals to
entertain an appeal from a final order in a habeas proceeding is de-
pendent on the issuance of a COA. See </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">28</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §2253(c)(l); Gonzalez
v. Thaler, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""620566""><a href=""/opinion/620566/gonzalez-v-thaler/""><span class=""volume"">565</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">134</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 142 (2012).
   In this case, petitioner appealed an order of the District Court that
denied both his request for funding under </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">18</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §3599 and his
underlying habeas claims. The Court of Appeals denied a COA as to
the merits of his request for habeas relief but held that a COA was not
required insofar as petitioner challenged the District Court’s denial of
funding under §3599. The Fifth Circuit relied on Harbison v. Bell, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""145892""><a href=""/opinion/145892/harbison-v-bell/""><span class=""volume"">556</span>
<span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">180</span></a></span><pre class=""inline""> (2009), in which a prisoner appealed from an order that
denied counsel under §3599 for a state clemency proceeding but that
did not address the merits of any habeas petition. This Court held that
a COA was not required. Here, petitioner took his appeal from the final
order in his habeas proceeding.
   The parties have not briefed whether that difference between Harbi-
son and the present case is relevant or whether an appeal from a denial
of a §3599 request for funding would fit within the COA framework,
and we find it unnecessary to resolve the issue. Though we take no
view on the merits, we will assume for the sake of argument that the
Court of Appeals could not entertain petitioner’s §3599 claim without
the issuance of a COA.
   We may review the denial of a COA by the lower courts. See, e.g.,
Miller-El v. Cockrell, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""122258""><a href=""/opinion/122258/miller-el-v-cockrell/""><span class=""volume"">537</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">322</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 326–327 (2003). When the lower
courts deny a COA and we conclude that their reason for doing so was
flawed, we may reverse and remand so that the correct legal standard
may be applied. See Slack v. McDaniel, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""118359""><a href=""/opinion/118359/slack-v-mcdaniel/""><span class=""volume"">529</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">473</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 485–486, 489–
490 (2000). We take that course here. As we will explain, the correct-
ness of the rule applied by the District Court in denying the funding
request was not only debatable; it was erroneous.

                           Opinion of the Court

Fifth Circuit under </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">28</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §§1291 and 2253, which
grant the courts of appeals jurisdiction to review final
“decisions” and “orders” of a district court.2 And when the
Fifth Circuit affirmed, petitioner sought review in this
Court under §1254, which gives us jurisdiction to review
“[c]ases” in the courts of appeals.3 As respondent correctly
notes, these provisions confer jurisdiction to review deci-
sions made by a district court in a judicial capacity. But
we have recognized that not all decisions made by a fed-

   The need for federal judges to make many administra-
tive decisions is obvious. The Federal Judiciary, while
tiny in comparison to the Executive Branch, is neverthe-
less a large and complex institution, with an annual budget
exceeding $7 billion and more than 32,000 employees.
See Administrative Office of the U. S. Courts, The Judici-

have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts
of the United States, the United States District Court for the District of
the Canal Zone, the District Court of Guam, and the District Court of
the Virgin Islands, except where a direct review may be had in the
Supreme Court.”
   Similarly, §2253 provides, as relevant, that “[i]n a habeas corpus
proceeding or a proceeding under section 2255 before a district judge,
the final order shall be subject to review, on appeal, by the court of
appeals for the circuit in which the proceeding is held.” §2253(a).

“final decision” on any such matter is appealable under
§1291 or reviewable in this Court under §1254. See Hohn,
supra; 15A C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal
Practice and Procedure §3903, pp. 134–135 (2d ed. 1992).
Such administrative decisions are not the kind of decisions
or orders—i.e., decisions or orders made in a judicial ca-
pacity—to which the relevant jurisdictional provisions
apply.
   Respondent argues that the denial of petitioner’s fund-
ing request was just such an administrative decision, but
the District Court’s ruling does not remotely resemble the
sort of administrative decisions noted above. Petitioner’s
request was made by motion in his federal habeas proceed-
ing, which is indisputably a judicial proceeding. And as
we will explain, resolution of the funding question re-
quires the application of a legal standard—whether the
funding is “reasonably necessary” for effective representa-
tion—that demands an evaluation of petitioner’s prospects
of obtaining habeas relief. We have never held that a
ruling like that is administrative and thus not subject to
appellate review under the standard jurisdictional provi-
sions.
   Respondent claims that two factors support the conclu-
sion that the funding decision was administrative, but her
argument is unpersuasive.

flawed.
   It is certainly true that cases and controversies in our
legal system are adversarial in nature, e.g., Bond v. United
States, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""218927""><a href=""/opinion/218927/bond-v-united-states/""><span class=""volume"">564</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">211</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 217 (2011); Aetna Life Ins. Co. v.

the habeas proceeding as a whole and the adjudication of
the specific issue of funding were adversarial. That the
habeas proceeding was adversarial is beyond dispute. And
on the funding question, petitioner and respondent plainly
have adverse interests and have therefore squared off as
adversaries. The motion for funding was formally noted
as “opposed” on the Disrict Court’s docket. App. 341. That
is not surprising: On one side, petitioner is seeking fund-
ing that he hopes will prevent his execution. On the other,
respondent wants to enforce the judgment of the Texas
courts and to do so without undue delay. Petitioner and
respondent have vigorously litigated the funding question
all the way to this Court.
   In arguing that the funding dispute is nonadversarial,
respondent attaches too much importance to the fact that
the request was made ex parte. As we have noted, the
“ex parte nature of a proceeding has not been thought to
imply that an act otherwise within a judge’s lawful juris-
diction was deprived of its judicial character.” Forrester v.
White, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""111977""><a href=""/opinion/111977/forrester-v-white/""><span class=""volume"">484</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">219</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 227 (1988).
   In our adversary system, ex parte motions are disfa-
vored, but they have their place. See, e.g., Hohn, supra, at

  Respondent’s second argument is based on the vener-
able principle “that Congress cannot vest review of the
decisions of Article III courts in” entities other than “supe-
rior courts in the Article III hierarchy.” Plaut v. Spend-

Hayburn’s Case, 2 Dall. 409 (1792)). Respondent claims
that §3599 funding decisions may be revised by the Direc-
tor of the Administrative Office of the Courts and that this
shows that such decisions must be administrative. This
argument, however, rests on a faulty premise. Nothing in
§3599 even hints that review by the Director of the Ad-
ministrative Office is allowed.
  Respondent’s argument rests in part on a handful of old
lower court cases that appear to have accepted Adminis-
trative Office review of Criminal Justice Act of 1964 (CJA)
payments that had been authorized by a District Court
and approved by the chief judge of the relevant Circuit.

                          Opinion of the Court

the United States Courts.”4
   It is not clear whether these decisions correctly inter-
preted the CJA,5 but in any event, no similar language
appears in §3599. And respondent has not identified a
single instance in which the Director of the Administrative
Office or any other nonjudicial officer has attempted to
review or alter a §3599 decision.
   Moreover, attorneys’ requests for CJA funds are mark-
edly different from the funding application at issue here.
Attorneys appointed under the CJA typically submit those
requests after the conclusion of the case, and the prosecu-
tion has no stake in the resolution of the matter. The
judgment in the criminal case cannot be affected by a
decision on compensation for services that have been
completed, and any funds awarded come out of the budget
of the Judiciary, not the Executive. See </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">18</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">.
§3006A(i) (2012 ed.). Thus, the adversaries in the crimi-
nal case are not pitted against each other. In this case,
on the other hand, as we have explained, petitioner
and respondent have strong adverse interests.             For
these reasons, we reject respondent’s argument that the
adjudication of the funding issue is nonadversarial and
administrative.
   Respondent, however, claims that the funding decision
is administrative for an additional reason. “A §3599(f )
funding determination is properly deemed administra-
tive,” she contends, “because it . . . may be revised outside
the traditional Article III judicial hierarchy.” Brief for
Respondent 23. The basis for this argument is a provision
of §3599 stating that funding in excess of the generally

  5 As far as we are aware, neither the Administrative Office nor any
other nonjudicial entity currently claims the power to revise or reject a
CJA compensation order issued by a court. Nothing in the CJA Guide-
lines suggests such a policy. See generally 7A Guide to Judiciary Policy
(May 17, 2017).

applicable statutory cap of $7,500 must be approved by the
chief judge of the circuit or another designated circuit
judge. §3599(g)(2). If a funding decision is judicial and
not administrative, respondent suggests, it could not be
reviewed by a single circuit judge as opposed to a panel of
three.
  This argument confuses what is familiar with what is
constitutionally required. Nothing in the Constitution ties
Congress to the typical structure of appellate review es-
tablished by statute. If Congress wishes to make certain
rulings reviewable by a single circuit judge, rather than a
panel of three, the Constitution does not stand in the way.
                             III
   Satisfied that we have jurisdiction, we turn to the ques-
tion whether the Court of Appeals applied the correct legal
standard when it affirmed the denial of petitioner’s fund-
ing request.
   Section 3599(a) authorizes federal courts to provide
funding to a party who is facing the prospect of a death
sentence and is “financially unable to obtain adequate
representation or investigative, expert, or other reason-
ably necessary services.” The statute applies to defendants
in federal cases, §3599(a)(1), as well as to state and federal
prisoners seeking collateral relief in federal court,
§3599(a)(2).
   Here we are concerned not with legal representation but
with services provided by experts, investigators, and the
like. Such services must be “reasonably necessary for the
representation of the [applicant]” in order to be eligible for
funding. §3599(f ). If the statutory standard is met, a
court “may authorize the [applicant’s] attorneys to obtain
such services on [his] behalf.” Ibid.
   The Fifth Circuit has held that individuals seeking
funding for such services must show that they have a
“substantial need” for the services. </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">817</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.</span> <span class=""page"">3d</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, at 896;

(2015). Petitioner contends that this interpretation is
more demanding than the standard—“reasonably neces-
sary”—set out in the statute. And although the difference
between the two formulations may not be great, petitioner
has a point.
   In the strictest sense of the term, something is “neces-
sary” only if it is essential. See Webster’s Third New
International Dictionary 1510 (1993) (something is neces-
sary if it “must be by reason of the nature of things,” if it
“cannot be otherwise by reason of inherent qualities”); 10
Oxford English Dictionary 275–276 (2d ed. 1989) (OED)
(defining the adjective “necessary” to mean “essential”).
But in ordinary speech, the term is often used more loosely
to refer to something that is merely important or strongly
desired. (“I need a vacation.” “I need to catch up with an
old friend.”) The term is sometimes used in a similar way
in the law. The term “necessary” in the Necessary and
Proper Clause does not mean “absolutely necessary,”
McCulloch v. Maryland, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""85272""><a href=""/opinion/85272/mculloch-v-state-of-maryland/""><span class=""volume"">4</span> <span class=""reporter"">Wheat.</span> <span class=""page"">316</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 414–415 (1819),
and a “necessary” business expense under the Internal
Revenue Code, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">26</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §162(a), may be an expense
that is merely helpful and appropriate, Commissioner v.
Tellier, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""107198""><a href=""/opinion/107198/commissioner-v-tellier/""><span class=""volume"">383</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">687</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 689 (1966). As Black’s Law Diction-
ary puts it, the term “may import absolute physical neces-
sity or inevitability, or it may import that which is only
convenient, useful, appropriate, suitable, proper, or condu-
cive to the end sought.” Black’s Law Dictionary 928 (5th
ed. 1979) (Black’s).
   Section 3599 appears to use the term “necessary” to
mean something less than essential. The provision applies
to services that are “reasonably necessary,” but it makes
little sense to refer to something as being “reasonably
essential.” What the statutory phrase calls for, we con-
clude, is a determination by the district court, in the exer-
16                   AYESTAS v. DAVIS

                     Opinion of the Court

cise of its discretion, as to whether a reasonable attorney
would regard the services as sufficiently important, guided
by the considerations we set out more fully below.
   The Fifth Circuit’s test—“substantial need”—is arguably
more demanding. We may assume that the term “need” is
comparable to “necessary”—that is, that something is
“needed” if it is “necessary.” But the term “substantial”
suggests a heavier burden than the statutory term “rea-
sonably.” Compare 13 OED 291 (defining “reasonably” to
mean, among other things, “[s]ufficiently, suitably, fairly”;
“[f ]airly or pretty well”) with 17 id., at 66–67 (defining
“substantial,” with respect to “reasons, causes, evidence,”
to mean “firmly or solidly established”); see also Black’s
1456 (10th ed. 2014) (defining “reasonable” to mean
“[f ]air, proper, or moderate under the circumstances . . .
See plausible”); id., at 1656 (defining “substantial” to
mean, among other things, “[i]mportant, essential, and
material”).
   The difference between “reasonably necessary” and
“substantially need[ed]” may be small, but the Fifth Cir-
cuit exacerbated the problem by invoking precedent to the
effect that a habeas petitioner seeking funding must pre-
sent “a viable constitutional claim that is not procedurally
barred.” </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">817</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.</span> <span class=""page"">3d</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, at 895 (internal quotation marks

   The Fifth Circuit adopted this rule before our decision in
Trevino, but after Trevino, the rule is too restrictive.

                      Opinion of the Court

Trevino permits a Texas prisoner to overcome the failure
to raise a substantial ineffective-assistance claim in state
court by showing that state habeas counsel was ineffec-
tive, 569 U. S., at 429, and it is possible that investigation
might enable a petitioner to carry that burden. In those
cases in which funding stands a credible chance of ena-
bling a habeas petitioner to overcome the obstacle of pro-
cedural default, it may be error for a district court to
refuse funding.
   Congress has made it clear, however, that district courts
have broad discretion in assessing requests for funding.
Section 3599’s predecessor declared that district courts
“shall authorize” funding for services deemed “reasonably
necessary.” </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">21</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §848(q)(9) (1988 ed.). Applying
this provision, courts of appeals reviewed district court
funding decisions for abuse of discretion. E.g., Bonin v.
Calderon, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""699264""><a href=""/opinion/699264/william-george-bonin-v-arthur-calderon-as-warden-of-san-quentin-state/""><span class=""volume"">59</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.3d</span> <span class=""page"">815</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 837 (CA9 1995); In re Lindsey, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""524115""><a href=""/opinion/524115/in-re-michael-lindsey/""><span class=""volume"">875</span>

Then, as part of the Anti-
terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 110
Stat. 1226, Congress changed the verb from “shall” to
“may,” and thus made it perfectly clear that determining
whether funding is “reasonably necessary” is a decision as
to which district courts enjoy broad discretion. See King-
domware Technologies, Inc. v. United States, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">579</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">___,
___ (2016) (slip op., at 9).
   A natural consideration informing the exercise of that
discretion is the likelihood that the contemplated services
will help the applicant win relief. After all, the proposed
services must be “reasonably necessary” for the applicant’s
representation, and it would not be reasonable—in fact, it
would be quite unreasonable—to think that services are
necessary to the applicant’s representation if, realistically
speaking, they stand little hope of helping him win relief.
Proper application of the “reasonably necessary” standard
thus requires courts to consider the potential merit of the
18                    AYESTAS v. DAVIS

                      Opinion of the Court

claims that the applicant wants to pursue, the likelihood
that the services will generate useful and admissible
evidence, and the prospect that the applicant will be able
to clear any procedural hurdles standing in the way.
    To be clear, a funding applicant must not be expected to
prove that he will be able to win relief if given the services
he seeks. But the “reasonably necessary” test requires an
assessment of the likely utility of the services requested,
and §3599(f ) cannot be read to guarantee that an appli-
cant will have enough money to turn over every stone.
    Petitioner does not deny this. He agrees that an appli-
cant must “articulat[e] specific reasons why the services
are warranted”—which includes demonstrating that the
underlying claim is at least “ ‘plausible’ ”—and he
acknowledges that there may even be cases in which it
would be within a court’s discretion to “deny funds after a
finding of ‘reasonable necessity.’ ” Brief for Petitioner 43.
    These interpretive principles are consistent with the
way in which §3599’s predecessors were read by the lower
courts. See, e.g., Alden, supra, at 318–319 (explaining
that it was “appropriate for the district court to satisfy
itself that [the] defendant may have a plausible defense
before granting the defendant’s . . . motion for psychiatric

   Perhaps anticipating that we might not accept the Fifth
Circuit’s reading of §3599(f ), respondent devotes a sub-
stantial portion of her brief to an alternative ground for
affirmance that was neither presented nor passed on
below.
   Respondent contends that whatever “reasonably neces-
sary” means, funding is never “reasonably necessary” in a
case like this one, where a habeas petitioner seeks to
present a procedurally defaulted ineffective-assistance-of-
trial-counsel claim that depends on facts outside the state-
court record. Citing </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">28</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §2254(e)(2), respondent
contends that the fruits of any such investigation would be
inadmissible in a federal habeas court.
   We decline to decide in the first instance whether re-
spondent’s reading of §2254(e)(2) is correct. Petitioner
agrees that the argument remains open for the Fifth
Circuit to consider on remand. Tr. of Oral Arg. 6.

 COREA, PETITIONER v. LORIE DAVIS, DIRECTOR, 

  TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE, 

    CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS DIVISION

 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT

                        [March 21, 2018]


    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG
joins, concurring.
    The Court correctly concludes that the Fifth Circuit
applied the wrong legal standard in evaluating a request
for funding for investigative services under </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">18</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">.
§3599(f ). That should come as no surprise, as the Fifth
Circuit required capital habeas petitioners to show a
“ ‘substantial need’ ” for services, when the statute requires
only a showing that the services are “ ‘reasonably neces-
sary.’ ” Ante, at 16. “Substantial,” of course, imposes a
higher burden than “reasonable.” Ante, at 16. The Fifth
Circuit “exacerbated the problem” by requiring a showing
of “a viable constitutional claim that is not procedurally
barred,” which ignores “that investigation might enable a
petitioner . . . to overcome the obstacle of procedural de-
fault.” Ante, at 16–17 (internal quotation marks omitted).
I therefore join the opinion of the Court in full holding
that to satisfy §3599(f ), a petitioner need only show that
“a reasonable attorney would regard the services as suffi-
ciently important.” Ante, at 16.
    Having answered the question presented of what is the
appropriate §3599(f ) standard, the Court remands Ayes-
tas’ case for the lower courts to consider the application of
2                       AYESTAS v. DAVIS

                     SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring

the standard in the first instance. Ante, at 19.1 I write
separately to explain why, on the record before this Court,
there should be little doubt that Ayestas has satisfied
§3599(f ).
                               I
   At the center of the §3599(f ) funding request in this
case is Ayestas’ claim that his trial counsel was ineffective
for failing to investigate mitigation. Specifically, Ayestas
claims that his trial counsel was deficient in failing to
conduct an investigation of his mental health and sub-
stance abuse, which could have been presented at the
penalty phase of the trial to convince the jury to spare his
life. As the Court notes, however, Ayestas faces a hurdle
in presenting this ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel
claim in his federal habeas petition, as his state postcon-
viction counsel never presented that claim in the Texas
collateral proceedings. See ante, at 5.
   To overcome that procedural default, Ayestas relies on
Martinez v. Ryan, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">566</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">1</span></span><pre class=""inline""> (2012), and Trevino v. Thaler,
</pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">569</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">413</span></span><pre class=""inline""> (2013). In those cases, this Court recognized
a “particular concern” in the application of a procedural
default rule that would prevent a petitioner from “pre-
sent[ing] a claim of trial error,” especially “when the claim
is one of ineffective assistance of counsel.” Martinez, 566
U. S., at 12. “The right to the effective assistance of coun-
sel,” the Court reasoned, “is a bedrock principle in our
justice system.” Ibid. The Court thus held that where the
“state procedural framework, by reason of its design and
operation, makes it highly unlikely in a typical case that a
defendant will have a meaningful opportunity to raise a
claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel on direct
appeal,” then “ ‘a procedural default will not bar a federal

——————
  1 The Court also declines to consider arguments that respondent ad-

vanced that were neither presented nor passed on below. Ante, at 19.

habeas court from hearing a substantial claim of ineffec-
tive assistance at trial if, in the initial-review collateral
proceeding, there was no counsel or counsel . . . was inef-
fective.’ ” Trevino, 569 U. S., at 429 (quoting Martinez, 566
U. S., at 17; alteration omitted).2
   Therefore, the fact that Ayestas’ postconviction counsel
failed to raise his ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel
claim in state court does not bar federal review of that
claim if Ayestas can show that the “attorney in his first
collateral proceeding was ineffective” and that “his claim
of ineffective assistance of trial counsel is substantial.”
Id., at 18. The substantiality of the ineffective-assistance-
of-trial-counsel claim and the ineffectiveness of postconvic-
tion counsel are both analyzed under the familiar frame-
work set out in Strickland v. Washington, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""111170""><a href=""/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/""><span class=""volume"">466</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">668</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">
(1984). “Ineffective assistance under Strickland is defi-
cient performance by counsel resulting in prejudice, with
performance being measured against an objective standard
of reasonableness.” Rompilla v. Beard, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""799980""><a href=""/opinion/799980/rompilla-v-beard/""><span class=""volume"">545</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">374</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 380
(2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
   Remember, however, the specific context in which inef-
fective assistance is being considered in Ayestas’ case: a
request under §3599(f ) for investigative services, which
requires a showing only that “a reasonable attorney would
regard the services as sufficiently important.” Ante, at 16.
Ayestas is not “expected to prove that he will be able to
win relief if given the services he seeks.” Ante, at 18

——————
  2 The reason for this exception is evident. Excusing the procedural

default “acknowledges, as an equitable matter, that the initial-review
collateral proceeding, if undertaken without counsel or with ineffective
counsel, may not have been sufficient.” Martinez, 566 U. S., at 14.
“Claims of ineffective assistance at trial often require investigative
work and an understanding of trial strategy,” and “the prisoner is in no
position to develop the evidentiary basis for a claim of ineffective
assistance, which often turns on evidence outside the trial record.” Id.,
at 11–12; see also Trevino, 569 U. S., at 423–424, 428.
4                        AYESTAS v. DAVIS

                      SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring

(emphasis in original). A court simply must consider at
this stage “the potential merit of the claims that the appli-
cant wants to pursue, the likelihood that the services will
generate useful and admissible evidence, and the prospect
that the applicant will be able to clear any procedural
hurdles standing in the way.” Ante, at 17–18. Thus, the
inquiry is not whether Ayestas can prove that his trial
counsel was ineffective under Strickland or whether he
will succeed in overcoming the procedural default under
Martinez and Trevino. Rather, at this §3599(f ) request
stage, the focus is on the potential merit of these claims.
                             II

                             A

  With this framework in mind, the focus first is on the
evidence of the deficient performance of Ayestas’ state-
appointed counsel.3 Trial counsel secured the appoint-
ment of an investigator, who met with Ayestas shortly
after the appointment. For nearly 15 months, however,
there was apparently no investigation into Ayestas’ history
in preparation for trial. Counsel instructed the investi-
gator “to resume investigation” only about a month before
jury selection. Record 878. The investigator then subpoe-
naed psychological and disciplinary prison records and
had Ayestas fill out a questionnaire, in response to which
Ayestas revealed that he had experienced multiple head
traumas and had a history of substance abuse. Jail rec-
ords also noted a rules infraction for possession of home-
made intoxicants. Trial counsel never followed up on any
of this information, sought further related records, or had
Ayestas evaluated by a mental health professional.
  About two weeks before jury selection, trial counsel for
the first time reached out to Ayestas’ family in Honduras.

——————
  3 The State appointed two attorneys to represent Ayestas at trial. I

refer to them together as “trial counsel.”

                      SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring

Shortly thereafter, five days before trial, counsel wrote
Ayestas’ family stating that she needed them to come
testify. Ayestas’ family agreed, but they indicated that
they could not obtain visas because a letter that trial
counsel was supposed to have sent to the U. S. Embassy to
facilitate their travel never arrived, and ultimately no
family members appeared at Ayestas’ trial.
   The guilt phase lasted two days, and trial counsel pre-
sented no witnesses. The penalty phase lasted less than a
day, and trial counsel presented two minutes of mitigation
evidence consisting of three letters from an instructor who
taught English classes to Ayestas in prison, attesting that
he was “a serious and attentive student.” App. 41–43.4
   On this record, Ayestas has made a strong showing that
trial counsel was deficient. “It is unquestioned that under
the prevailing professional norms at the time of [Ayestas’]
trial, counsel had an obligation to conduct a thorough
investigation of [his] background.” Porter v. McCollum,
</pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""1756""><a href=""/opinion/1756/porter-v-mccollum/""><span class=""volume"">558</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">30</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 39 (2009) (per curiam) (internal quotation
marks omitted). Here, Ayestas’ trial counsel “clearly did
not satisfy those norms.” Ibid. With a client facing a
possible death sentence, counsel and her investigator did
not start looking into Ayestas’ personal history until the
eve of trial. The little the investigator uncovered—head
trauma and a history of substance abuse—should have
prompted further inquiry. Yet trial counsel did nothing.
Even if Ayestas prohibited counsel from contacting his
family in Honduras until the start of trial was imminent,
see ante, at 3,5 that still would not explain why counsel
——————
  4 Trial counsel also attempted to introduce evidence that Ayestas had

no criminal history in Honduras, but failed to link Ayestas to the
records, which were under his given name, “Dennis Zelaya Corea.” See
Ayestas v. Stephens, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">817</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.3d</span> <span class=""page"">888</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 892, n. 1 (CA5 2016) (per curiam).
  5 During postconviction proceedings, trial counsel filed an affidavit

asserting that Ayestas did not allow contact with his family in Hondu-
ras until after jury selection had commenced. When the record evi-
6                         AYESTAS v. DAVIS

                       SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring

failed to perform any other mitigation investigation, see
Porter, 558 U. S., at 40 (noting that even if the defendant
is “uncooperative, . . . that does not obviate the need for
defense counsel to conduct some sort of mitigation investi-
gation (emphasis in original)). In the end, the decision to
sentence Ayestas to death was made in less than one day,
and his counsel spent less than two minutes presenting
mitigation to the jury. Two minutes.
  This Court has recognized that the decision not to pre-
sent mitigation may be supported in certain cases by
“strategic judgments,” provided the reviewing court is
satisfied with “the adequacy of the investigations support-
ing those judgments.” Wiggins v. Smith, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""130159""><a href=""/opinion/130159/wiggins-v-smith-warden/""><span class=""volume"">539</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">510</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">,
521 (2003). But this does not appear to be one of those
cases. There is nothing in the record that would support
the conclusion that counsel chose the two-minutes-of-
mitigation strategy after careful investigation and consid-
eration of Ayestas’ case. Instead, counsel for the most part
“did not even take the first step of interviewing witnesses
or requesting records” and “ignored pertinent avenues for
investigation of which [they] should have been aware.”
Porter, 558 U. S., at 39–40.
  In evaluating the potential merit of Ayestas’ claim, the
Fifth Circuit misapplied Strickland and the §3599(f )
standard. It reasoned that Ayestas had not presented a
viable claim that trial counsel was deficient in failing to
investigate Ayestas’ mental illness because, as he was not
diagnosed with schizophrenia until his time in prison,
there was nothing that flagged mental illness issues prior
to trial.6 See Ayestas v. Stephens, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">817</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.3d</span> <span class=""page"">888</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 895–897
——————
dence contradicted that assertion, counsel submitted another affidavit
with a revised timeline. Ayestas disputes having instructed trial
counsel not to contact his family in Honduras.
  6 It is unclear whether the Fifth Circuit ultimately relied on its de-

termination that trial counsel was not deficient in rejecting Ayestas’
claims. In its panel opinion, it incorrectly stated that trial counsel had
                     Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)                   7

                      SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring

(2016) (per curiam). The absence of a documented diagno-
sis, however, did not excuse trial counsel from their “obli-
gation to conduct a thorough investigation of [Ayestas’]
background.” Porter, 558 U. S., at 39 (internal quotation
marks omitted). In fact, the obligation to investigate
exists in part precisely because it is all too common for
individuals to go years battling an undiagnosed and un-
treated mental illness.
   In any event, the Fifth Circuit failed to consider that
one of the purposes of the §3599(f ) investigation was to
look at Ayestas’ life around the time of the crime and trial
to determine if there were mitigating circumstances that
trial counsel could have discovered, such as whether
symptoms of his schizophrenia had begun to manifest even
before his diagnosis. The Court makes clear today that in
evaluating §3599(f ) funding requests, courts must consider
“the likelihood that the services will generate useful and
admissible evidence.” Ante, at 17. It was error, therefore,
for the Fifth Circuit to evaluate the merit of the ineffec-
tive-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim and to deny §3599(f )
funding based solely on an evaluation of the evidence in
the record at the time of the request, without evaluating
the potential evidence that Ayestas sought. Ante, at
17–18.
                             B
  The evidence concerning the deficiency of Ayestas’ state
postconviction counsel is similarly strong. State postcon-
viction counsel retained the services of a mitigation spe-
cialist, who prepared an investigation plan noting that it

After Ayestas corrected the record in his petition for rehearing, the
panel issued an order reaffirming its holding, relying on its finding of
no prejudice. See Ayestas v. Stephens, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">826</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.3d</span> <span class=""page"">214</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 215 (2016) ( per
curiam). Still, the Fifth Circuit never disavowed its conclusion regard-
ing trial-counsel deficiency. Ibid.
8                     AYESTAS v. DAVIS

was “obvious no social history investigation was conducted”
and that the jury had “heard nothing about [Ayestas’] . . .
mental health, possible mental illness, [or] substance
abuse history.” App. 81, 266. The plan also noted that it
was “clear that [Ayestas] had a history of substance
abuse.” Record 721; see also App. 267. The specialist
recommended a comprehensive investigation into Ayestas’
biological, psychological, and social history to explore,
inter alia, issues related to addiction and mental health.
   State postconviction counsel failed to follow these rec-
ommendations. He did nothing to investigate issues related
to Ayestas’ mental health or substance abuse. Notably,
Ayestas suffered a psychotic episode and was diagnosed
with schizophrenia while his state postconviction applica-
tion was pending. Moreover, in 2003, a counsel-arranged
evaluation pursuant Atkins v. Virginia, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""121158""><a href=""/opinion/121158/atkins-v-virginia/""><span class=""volume"">536</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">304</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">
(2002), noted concerns about Ayestas’ “delusional think-
ing.” App. 139–140. These events still did not prompt
counsel to investigate Ayestas’ mental health history.
   Instead, state postconviction counsel explored the cir-
cumstances of Ayestas’ arrest, conducted some juror inter-
views, and interviewed Ayestas’ mother and sisters, ob-
taining affidavits regarding Ayestas’ upbringing in
Honduras and their interactions with trial counsel. Post-
conviction counsel eventually filed an application that
contained a narrow claim of ineffective assistance of trial
counsel with respect to mitigation regarding the attorneys’
failure to secure the attendance of Ayestas’ family mem-
bers at trial. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals denied
the application, relying on the affidavit submitted by trial
counsel, see n. 4, supra, to find no ineffectiveness in failing
to get Ayestas’ family to attend trial.
   The Fifth Circuit concluded that Ayestas’ state postcon-
viction counsel was not ineffective because, in its view,
Ayestas had not established any deficiency at trial in the
failure to investigate mental health and substance abuse
                 Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)            9

mitigation. See </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">817</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.</span> <span class=""page"">3d</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, at 898. That conclusion, as
noted in Part II–A, supra, was based on a misapplication
of Strickland and the §3599(f ) standard, and thus cannot
support a finding that the failure to present the claim in
postconviction proceedings was “strategic.” </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">817</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.</span> <span class=""page"">3d</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, at
898. Nor is there anything else in the record that would
excuse that deficiency. State postconviction counsel ig-
nored his own mitigation specialist, who alerted him to a
serious failing in the trial because the jury heard virtually
no mitigation and to the serious failings of trial counsel
because of the failure to conduct a social history investiga-
tion of Ayestas. Even after Ayestas’ psychotic episode,
schizophrenia diagnosis, and documented tendencies of
“delusional thinking” during the course of the representa-
tion, state postconviction counsel did nothing. As with
trial counsel, the record provides no support for any “stra-
tegic justification” to disregard completely a mitigation
investigation of Ayestas’ mental health and substance
abuse.
                             III
   Strickland next requires consideration of prejudice. To
establish prejudice, this Court has held that a “defendant
must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but
for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the pro-
ceeding would have been different,” meaning “a probabil-
ity sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.”
466 U. S., at 694. In cases alleging a failure to investigate
mitigation, as here, the Court must “reweigh the evidence
in aggravation against the totality of available mitigating
evidence.” Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 534.
   Even with the scant evidence in the record at this time
as to what Ayestas could have presented to the jury in the
form of mitigation, Ayestas has made a strong showing
that his claim has potential merit. That trial counsel
presented only two minutes of mitigation already goes a
10                      AYESTAS v. DAVIS

                     SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring

long way to establishing prejudice.           In fact, the State
emphasized to the jury at sentencing:
     “Does he have anything there that would lead you to
     conclude there is some type of mitigation, anything at
     all? There is no drug problem . . . no health problem
     . . . no alcohol problem. . . . [O]nly . . . these three pieces
     of paper . . . . Making steps to learn a second lan-
     guage does not lessen his moral blameworthiness
     . . . .” Record 4747.
The State, in contrast, presented evidence of Ayestas’
criminal history as well as victim impact testimony. After
deliberating for only 25 minutes, the jury assessed a pun-
ishment of death against Ayestas, finding that he was a
future danger, that he intended to cause death or antici-
pated the loss of life, and that there were no mitigating
circumstances that warranted imposition of a life sentence
over a death sentence. Had just one juror dissented on a
single one of these findings, no death sentence could have
been imposed. See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art.
37.071, §2(g) (Vernon Cum. Supp. 2017); see also ante, at
2. With even minimal investigation by trial counsel, at
least one may well have, as this Court has held that evi-
dence of mental illness and substance abuse is relevant to
assessing moral culpability. See Rompilla, 545 U. S., at
393; Porter, 558 U. S., at 43–44. Instead, the jury “heard
almost nothing that would humanize [him] or allow them
to accurately gauge his moral culpability.” Id., at 41.
There is thus good reason to believe that, were Ayestas’
§3599(f ) motion granted, he could establish prejudice
under Strickland.
   The Fifth Circuit held otherwise based on its belief that
no amount of mitigation would have changed the outcome
of the sentencing given the “brutality of the crime.” </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">817</span>

assessing prejudice, a court must “consider the totality of
the available mitigation evidence . . . and reweigh it
against the evidence in aggravation.” Porter, 558 U. S., at
41 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted); see

Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 534. By considering aggravation in
isolation, the Fifth Circuit directly contravened this fun-
damental principle.7

  In sum, Ayestas has made a strong showing that he is
entitled to §3599(f ) funding. As the Court notes, the
statute affords district courts some discretion in these
funding determinations, even where a petitioner shows
the services are “ ‘reasonably necessary.’ ” Ante, at 17–18.
Exercise of that discretion may be appropriate if there is a
showing of gamesmanship or where the State has provided
funding for the same investigation services, as Ayestas
conceded at argument. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 13. Nonethe-
less, the troubling failures of counsel at both the trial and
state postconviction stages of Ayestas’ case are exactly the
types of facts that should prompt courts to afford investi-
gatory services to ensure that trial errors that go to a
“bedrock principle in our justice system” do not go un-
addressed. Martinez, 566 U. S., at 12.

  7 Notably, application of this “brutality of the crime” rule is particu-

larly irrational in the §3599(f ) context, where the court is unaware of
what the undiscovered evidence of mitigation looks like.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT

   No. 16–6795. Argued October 30, 2017—Decided March 21, 2018
Petitioner Ayestas was convicted of murder and sentenced to death in a
  Texas state court. He secured new counsel, but his conviction and
  sentence were affirmed on appeal. A third legal team sought, unsuc-
  cessfully, state habeas relief, claiming trial-level ineffective assis-
  tance of counsel but not counsel’s failure to investigate petitioner’s
  mental health and alcohol and drug abuse during the trial’s penalty
  phase. His fourth set of attorneys did raise that failure in a federal
  habeas petition, but because the claim had never been raised in state
  court, the District Court held, it was barred by procedural default.
  That decision was vacated and remanded for reconsideration in light
  of Martinez v. Ryan, 566 U. S. 1—where this Court held that an Ari-
  zona prisoner seeking federal habeas relief could overcome the proce-
  dural default of a trial-level ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim by
  showing that the claim is substantial and that state habeas counsel
  was also ineffective in failing to raise the claim in a state habeas pro-
  ceeding—and Trevino v. Thaler, 569 U. S. 413—which extended that
  holding to Texas prisoners. Petitioner filed an ex parte motion asking
  the District Court for funding to develop his claim that both his trial
  and state habeas counsel were ineffective, relying on 18 U. S. C.
  §3599(f), which provides, in relevant part, that a district court “may
  authorize” funding for “investigative, expert, or other services . . .
  reasonably necessary for the representation of the defendant.” The
  court found his claim precluded by procedural default and thus de-
  nied his funding request. The Fifth Circuit also rejected the funding
  claim under its precedent: that a §3599(f) funding applicant must
  show that he has a “substantial need” for investigative or other ser-
2                         AYESTAS v. DAVIS

 vices, and that funding may be denied when an applicant fails to pre-
 sent “a viable constitutional claim that is not procedurally barred.”
 817 F. 3d 888, 895–896.
Held:
    1. The District Court’s denial of petitioner’s funding request was a
 judicial decision subject to appellate review under the standard juris-
 dictional provisions. Pp. 7–14.
       (a) Title 28 U. S. C. §§1291, 2253, and 1254 confer jurisdiction to
 review decisions made by a district court in a judicial capacity. “Ad-
 ministrative” decisions—about, e.g., facilities, personnel, equipment,
 supplies, and rules of procedure—are “not subject to [this Court’s] re-
 view,” Hohn v. United States, 524 U. S. 236, 245, but the District
 Court’s ruling here does not remotely resemble such decisions. Peti-
 tioner’s request was made by motion in his federal habeas proceed-
 ing, which is indisputably a judicial proceeding. And resolution of
 the funding question requires the application of a legal standard—
 whether the funding is “reasonably necessary” for effective represen-
 tation—that demands an evaluation of petitioner’s prospects of ob-
 taining habeas relief. Pp. 8–10.
       (b) Respondent’s arguments in support of her claim that §3599’s
 funding requests are nonadversarial and administrative are unper-
 suasive. First, that the requests can be decided ex parte does not
 make the proceeding nonadversarial. The habeas proceeding here
 was clearly adversarial. And petitioner and respondent plainly have
 adverse interests on the funding question and have therefore squared
 off as adversaries. The mere fact that a §3599 funding request may
 sometimes be made ex parte is thus hardly dispositive. Second, noth-
 ing in §3599 even hints that the funding decisions may be revised by
 the Director of the Administrative Office of the Courts. Lower court
 cases that appear to have accepted Administrative Office review of
 certain Criminal Justice Act (CJA) payments, even if a proper inter-
 pretation of the CJA, are inapposite.           Finally, the fact that
 §3599(g)(2) requires funding in excess of the generally applicable
 statutory cap to be approved by the circuit’s chief judge or another
 designated circuit judge, instead of by a panel of three, does not make
 the proceeding administrative. If Congress wishes to make certain
 rulings reviewable by a single circuit judge, the Constitution does not
 stand in the way. Pp. 10–14.
    2. The Fifth Circuit did not apply the correct legal standard in af-
 firming the denial of petitioner’s funding request. Section 3599 au-
 thorizes funding for the “reasonably necessary” services of experts,
 investigators, and the like. But the Fifth Circuit’s requirement that
 applicants show a “substantial need” for the services is arguably a
 more demanding standard. Section 3599 appears to use the term
                     Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)                     3

                                Syllabus

  “necessary” to mean something less than essential. Because it makes
  little sense to refer to something as being “reasonably essential,” the
  Court concludes that the statutory phrase calls for the district court
  to determine, in its discretion, whether a reasonable attorney would
  regard the services as sufficiently important, guided by considera-
  tions detailed in the opinion. The term “substantial” in the Fifth Cir-
  cuit’s test, however, suggests a heavier burden. And that court exac-
  erbated the difference by also requiring a funding applicant to
  present “a viable constitutional claim that is not procedurally
  barred.” That rule that is too restrictive after Trevino, see 569 U. S.
  at 429, because, in cases where funding stands a credible chance of
  enabling a habeas petitioner to overcome the procedural default ob-
  stacle, it may be error for a district court to refuse funding. That be-
  ing said, district courts were given broad discretion in assessing fund-
  ing requests when Congress changed the phrase “shall authorize” in
  §3599’s predecessor statute, see 21 U. S. C. §848(q)(9), to “may au-
  thorize” in §3599(f). A funding applicant must not be expected to
  prove that he will be able to win relief if given the services, but the
  “reasonably necessary” test does require an assessment of the likely
  utility of the services requested.
     Respondent’s alternative ground for affirmance—that funding is
  never “reasonably necessary” where a habeas petitioner seeks to pre-
  sent a procedurally defaulted ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel
  claim that depends on facts outside the state-court record—remains
  open for the Fifth Circuit to consider on remand. Pp. 14–19.

 CARLOS MANUEL AYESTAS, AKA DENNIS ZELAYA

 COREA, PETITIONER v. LORIE DAVIS, DIRECTOR, 

  TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE, 

    CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS DIVISION

 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT

                               [March 21, 2018]


  JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.
  Petitioner Carlos Ayestas, who was convicted of murder
and sentenced to death in a Texas court, argues that he
was wrongfully denied funding for investigative services
needed to prove his entitlement to federal habeas relief.
Petitioner moved for funding under 18 U. S. C. §3599(f ),
which makes funds available if they are “reasonably nec-
essary,” but petitioner’s motion was denied. We hold that
the lower courts applied the wrong legal standard, and we
therefore vacate the judgment below and remand for
further proceedings.
                              I

                              A

  In 1997, petitioner was convicted of capital murder in a
Texas court. Evidence at trial showed that he and two
accomplices invaded the home of a 67-year-old Houston
woman, Santiaga Paneque, bound her with duct tape and
electrical cord, beat and strangled her, and then made off
with a stash of her belongings.
2                    AYESTAS v. DAVIS

                     Opinion of the Court

   The jury also heard testimony from Henry Nuila regard-
ing an incident that occurred about two weeks after the
murder. Petitioner was drunk at the time, and he re-
vealed to Nuila that he had recently murdered a woman in
Houston. Petitioner then brandished an Uzi machinegun
and threatened to murder Nuila if he did not help peti-
tioner kill his two accomplices. Fortunately for Nuila,
petitioner kept talking until he eventually passed out;
Nuila then called the police, who arrested petitioner, still
in possession of the gun.
   After the jury found petitioner guilty, it was asked to
determine whether he should be sentenced to death or to
life in prison. In order to impose a death sentence, Texas
law required the jury to answer the following three ques-
tions. First, would petitioner pose a continuing threat to
society? Second, had he personally caused the death of the
victim, intended to kill her, or anticipated that she would
be killed? Third, in light of all the evidence surrounding
the crime and petitioner’s background, were there suffi-
cient mitigating circumstances to warrant a sentence of
life without parole instead of death? Tex. Code Crim.
Proc. Ann., Art. 37.071, §§2(b), (e) (Vernon Cum. Supp.
2017). Only if the jury gave a unanimous yes to the first
two questions, and a unanimous no to the third question,
could a death sentence be imposed; otherwise, petitioner
would receive a sentence of life without parole. See
§§2(d)(2), (f )(2), (g).
   In asking the jury to impose a death sentence, the pros-
ecution supplemented the trial record with evidence of
petitioner’s criminal record and his encounter with a man
named Candelario Martinez a few days after the murder.
Martinez told the jury that he was standing in a hotel
parking lot waiting for a friend when petitioner ap-
proached and began to make small talk. Before long,
petitioner pulled out a machinegun and forced Martinez
into a room where two of petitioner’s compatriots were
                  Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)            3

                      Opinion of the Court

holding Martinez’s friend at knifepoint. Ordered to lie
down on the bathroom floor and await his execution,
Martinez begged for his life while petitioner and his co-
horts haggled about who would carry out the killing.
Finally, petitioner relented, but he threatened to kill
Martinez and his family if he contacted the police. Peti-
tioner then stole Martinez’s truck.
   Petitioner’s trial counsel presented very little mitigation
evidence. This was due, at least in part, to petitioner’s
steadfast refusal for many months to allow his lawyers to
contact his family members, who were living in Honduras
and might have testified about his character and upbring-
ing. Petitioner gave in on the eve of trial, and at that
point, according to the state habeas courts, his lawyers
“made every effort to contact [his] family.” App. 171.
They repeatedly contacted petitioner’s family members
and urged them to attend the trial; they requested that
the U. S. Embassy in Honduras facilitate family members’
travel to the United States; and they met in person with
the Honduran Consulate to seek assistance. But these
efforts were to no avail. Petitioner’s sister told his legal
team that the family would not leave Honduras because
the journey would create economic hardship and because
their father was ill and had killed one of their neighbors.
A defense attorney who spoke to petitioner’s mother testi-
fied that she seemed unconcerned about her son’s situa-
tion. In general, the state habeas courts found, petitioner
“did nothing to assist counsel’s efforts to contact his family
and did not want them contacted by the consulate or
counsel.” Id., at 174.
   In the end, the only mitigation evidence introduced by
petitioner’s trial counsel consisted of three letters from
petitioner’s English instructor. The letters, each two
sentences long, described petitioner as “a serious and
attentive student who is progressing well in English.”

4                    AYESTAS v. DAVIS

                     Opinion of the Court

  The jury unanimously concluded that petitioner should
be sentenced to death, and a capital sentence was im-
posed. Petitioner secured new counsel to handle his ap-
peal, and his conviction and sentence were affirmed by the
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals in 1998. Ayestas v.
State, No. 72,928, App. 115. Petitioner did not seek review
at that time from this Court.
                              B
   While petitioner’s direct appeal was still pending, a
third legal team filed a habeas petition on his behalf in
state court. This petition included several claims of trial-
level ineffective assistance of counsel, but the petition did
not assert that trial counsel were ineffective for failing to
investigate petitioner’s mental health and abuse of alcohol
and drugs. Petitioner’s quest for state habeas relief ended
unsuccessfully in 2008. Ex parte Ayestas, No. WR–69,674–
01 (Tex. Ct. Crim. App., Sept. 10, 2008), 2008 WL 4151814
(per curiam) (unpublished).
   In 2009, represented by a fourth set of attorneys, peti-
tioner filed a federal habeas petition under 28 U. S. C.
§2254, and this time he did allege that his right to the
effective assistance of counsel at trial was violated because
his attorneys failed to conduct an adequate search for
mitigation evidence. As relevant here, petitioner argued
that trial counsel overlooked evidence that he was mentally
ill and had a history of drug and alcohol abuse. Ayestas
v. Thaler, Civ. Action No. H–09–2999 (SD Tex., Jan. 26,
2011), 2011 WL 285138, *4. Petitioner alleged that he had
a history of substance abuse, and he noted that he had
been diagnosed with schizophrenia while the state habeas
proceeding was still pending. See Pet. for Writ of Habeas
Corpus in Ayestas v. Quarterman, No. 4:09–cv–2999 (SD
Tex.), Doc. 1, pp. 21–23. Petitioner claimed that trial
counsel’s deficient performance caused prejudice because
there was a reasonable chance that an adequate investiga-
                 Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)            5

                     Opinion of the Court

tion would have produced mitigation evidence that would
have persuaded the jury to spare his life.
   Among the obstacles standing between petitioner and
federal habeas relief, however, was the fact that he never
raised this trial-level ineffective-assistance-of-counsel
claim in state court. The District Court therefore held
that the claim was barred by procedural default, Ayestas v.
Thaler, 2011 WL 285138, *4–*7, and the Fifth Circuit
affirmed, Ayestas v. Thaler, 462 Fed. Appx. 474, 482
(2012) (per curiam).
   Petitioner sought review in this Court, and we vacated
the decision below and remanded for reconsideration in
light of two of our subsequent decisions, Martinez v. Ryan,
566 U. S. 1 (2012), and Trevino v. Thaler, 569 U. S. 413
(2013). Ayestas v. Thaler, 569 U. S. 1015 (2013). Martinez
held that an Arizona prisoner seeking federal habeas relief
could overcome the procedural default of a trial-level
ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim by showing that the
claim is substantial and that state habeas counsel was
also ineffective in failing to raise the claim in a state
habeas proceeding. 566 U. S., at 14. Trevino extended
that holding to Texas prisoners, 569 U. S., at 416–417, and
on remand, petitioner argued that he fell within Trevino
because effective state habeas counsel would have uncov-
ered evidence showing that trial counsels’ investigative
efforts were deficient.
   To assist in developing these claims, petitioner filed an
ex parte motion asking the District Court for $20,016 in
funding to conduct a search for evidence supporting his
petition. He relied on 18 U. S. C. §3599(f ), which provides
in relevant part as follows:
       “Upon a finding that investigative, expert, or other
    services are reasonably necessary for the representa-
    tion of the defendant, whether in connection with is-
    sues relating to guilt or the sentence, the court may
6                    AYESTAS v. DAVIS

                     Opinion of the Court

    authorize the defendant’s attorneys to obtain such
    services on behalf of the defendant and, if so author-
    ized, shall order the payment of fees and expenses
    therefor.”
Petitioner averred that the funds would be used to conduct
an investigation that would show that his trial counsel
and his state habeas counsel were ineffective. Accordingly,
he claimed, the investigation would establish both that
his trial-level ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim was
not barred by procedural default and that he was entitled
to resentencing based on the denial of his Sixth Amend-
ment right to the effective assistance of trial counsel.
   The District Court refused the funding request and
ultimately denied petitioner’s habeas petition. Ayestas v.
Stephens, Civ. Action No. H–09–2999, (SD Tex., Nov. 18,
2014), 2014 WL 6606498, *6–*7. On the merits of peti-
tioner’s new ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim,
the District Court held that petitioner failed both prongs
of the Strickland test. See Strickland v. Washington, 466
U. S. 668 (1984). Noting that most of the evidence bearing
on petitioner’s mental health had emerged only after he
was sentenced, the court concluded that petitioner’s trial
lawyers were not deficient in failing to find such evidence
in time for the sentencing proceeding. 2014 WL 6606498,
*5. In addition, the court found that state habeas counsel
did not render deficient performance by failing to investi-
gate petitioner’s history of substance abuse, and that, in
any event, petitioner was not prejudiced at the sentencing
phase of the trial or during the state habeas proceedings
because the potential mitigation evidence at issue would
not have made a difference to the jury in light of “the
extremely brutal nature of [the] crime and [petitioner’s]
history of criminal violence.” Ibid.
   With respect to funding, the District Court pointed to
Fifth Circuit case law holding that a §3599(f ) funding
                     Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)                  7

                         Opinion of the Court

applicant cannot show that investigative services are
“ ‘reasonably necessary’ ” unless the applicant can show
that he has a “ ‘substantial need’ ” for those services. Id.,
at *6. In addition, the court noted that “[t]he Fifth Circuit
upholds the denial of funding” when, among other things,
“a petitioner has . . . failed to supplement his funding
request with a viable constitutional claim that is not
procedurally barred.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks
omitted).
    Given its holding that petitioner’s new ineffective-
assistance-of-counsel claim was precluded by procedural
default, this rule also doomed his request for funding. The
District Court denied petitioner’s habeas petition and
refused to grant him a certificate of appealability (COA).
Id., at *7. On appeal, the Fifth Circuit held that a COA
was not needed for review of the funding issue, but it
rejected that claim for essentially the same reasons as the
District Court, citing both the “substantial need” test and
the rule that funding may be denied when a funding appli-
cant fails to present “a viable constitutional claim that is
not procedurally barred.” Ayestas v. Stephens, 817 F. 3d
888, 895–896 (2016) (internal quotation marks omitted).
With respect to petitioner’s other claims, including his
claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, the Fifth
Circuit refused to issue a COA. Id., at 898.
                             C
  We granted certiorari to decide whether the lower courts
applied the correct legal standard in denying the funding
request. 581 U. S. ___ (2017).
                            II
  Before we reach that question, however, we must con-
sider a jurisdictional argument advanced by respondent,
the Director of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.1
——————
 1 We   also consider a jurisdictional issue not raised by the parties,
8                        AYESTAS v. DAVIS

                         Opinion of the Court

Respondent contends that the District Court’s denial of
petitioner’s funding request was an administrative, not a
judicial, decision and therefore falls outside the scope of
the jurisdictional provisions on which petitioner relied in
seeking review in the Court of Appeals and in this Court.
                           A
  When the District Court denied petitioner’s funding
request and his habeas petition, he took an appeal to the
——————
namely, whether we have jurisdiction even though no COA has yet
been issued. We do not have jurisdiction if jurisdiction was lacking in
the Court of Appeals, and the jurisdiction of a court of appeals to
entertain an appeal from a final order in a habeas proceeding is de-
pendent on the issuance of a COA. See 28 U. S. C. §2253(c)(l); Gonzalez
v. Thaler, 565 U. S. 134, 142 (2012).
   In this case, petitioner appealed an order of the District Court that
denied both his request for funding under 18 U. S. C. §3599 and his
underlying habeas claims. The Court of Appeals denied a COA as to
the merits of his request for habeas relief but held that a COA was not
required insofar as petitioner challenged the District Court’s denial of
funding under §3599. The Fifth Circuit relied on Harbison v. Bell, 556
U. S. 180 (2009), in which a prisoner appealed from an order that
denied counsel under §3599 for a state clemency proceeding but that
did not address the merits of any habeas petition. This Court held that
a COA was not required. Here, petitioner took his appeal from the final
order in his habeas proceeding.
   The parties have not briefed whether that difference between Harbi-
son and the present case is relevant or whether an appeal from a denial
of a §3599 request for funding would fit within the COA framework,
and we find it unnecessary to resolve the issue. Though we take no
view on the merits, we will assume for the sake of argument that the
Court of Appeals could not entertain petitioner’s §3599 claim without
the issuance of a COA.
   We may review the denial of a COA by the lower courts. See, e.g.,
Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322, 326–327 (2003). When the lower
courts deny a COA and we conclude that their reason for doing so was
flawed, we may reverse and remand so that the correct legal standard
may be applied. See Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 485–486, 489–
490 (2000). We take that course here. As we will explain, the correct-
ness of the rule applied by the District Court in denying the funding
request was not only debatable; it was erroneous.

Fifth Circuit under 28 U. S. C. §§1291 and 2253, which
grant the courts of appeals jurisdiction to review final
“decisions” and “orders” of a district court.2 And when the
Fifth Circuit affirmed, petitioner sought review in this
Court under §1254, which gives us jurisdiction to review
“[c]ases” in the courts of appeals.3 As respondent correctly
notes, these provisions confer jurisdiction to review deci-
sions made by a district court in a judicial capacity. But
we have recognized that not all decisions made by a fed-
eral court are “judicial” in nature; some decisions are prop-
erly understood to be “administrative,” and in that case they
are “not subject to our review.” Hohn v. United States, 524
U. S. 236, 245 (1998).
   The need for federal judges to make many administra-
tive decisions is obvious. The Federal Judiciary, while
tiny in comparison to the Executive Branch, is neverthe-
less a large and complex institution, with an annual budget
exceeding $7 billion and more than 32,000 employees.
See Administrative Office of the U. S. Courts, The Judici-
ary FY 2018 Congressional Budget Summary Revised 9–
10 (June 2017). Administering this operation requires
many “decisions” in the ordinary sense of the term—

  2 In relevant part §1291 declares that “[t]he courts of appeals . . . shall
have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts
of the United States, the United States District Court for the District of
the Canal Zone, the District Court of Guam, and the District Court of
the Virgin Islands, except where a direct review may be had in the
Supreme Court.”
   Similarly, §2253 provides, as relevant, that “[i]n a habeas corpus
proceeding or a proceeding under section 2255 before a district judge,
the final order shall be subject to review, on appeal, by the court of
appeals for the circuit in which the proceeding is held.” §2253(a).

Court by . . . writ of certiorari granted upon the petition of any party to
any civil or criminal case, before or after rendition of judgment or
decree.” §1254(1).

equipment, supplies, and rules of procedure. In re Appli-
cation for Exemption from Electronic Pub. Access Fees by
Jennifer Gollan and Shane Shifflett, 728 F. 3d 1033, 1037
(CA9 2013). It would be absurd to suggest that every
“final decision” on any such matter is appealable under
§1291 or reviewable in this Court under §1254. See Hohn,
supra; 15A C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal
Practice and Procedure §3903, pp. 134–135 (2d ed. 1992).
Such administrative decisions are not the kind of decisions
or orders—i.e., decisions or orders made in a judicial ca-
pacity—to which the relevant jurisdictional provisions
apply.
   Respondent argues that the denial of petitioner’s fund-
ing request was just such an administrative decision, but
the District Court’s ruling does not remotely resemble the
sort of administrative decisions noted above. Petitioner’s
request was made by motion in his federal habeas proceed-
ing, which is indisputably a judicial proceeding. And as
we will explain, resolution of the funding question re-
quires the application of a legal standard—whether the
funding is “reasonably necessary” for effective representa-
tion—that demands an evaluation of petitioner’s prospects
of obtaining habeas relief. We have never held that a
ruling like that is administrative and thus not subject to
appellate review under the standard jurisdictional provi-
sions.
   Respondent claims that two factors support the conclu-
sion that the funding decision was administrative, but her
argument is unpersuasive.
                             B
  Respondent first argues as follows: Judicial proceedings
must be adversarial; 18 U. S. C. §3599(f ) funding adjudi-
cations are not adversarial because the statute allows
requests to be decided ex parte; therefore, §3599(f ) funding
adjudications are not judicial in nature. This reasoning is
                 Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)           11

                     Opinion of the Court

flawed.
   It is certainly true that cases and controversies in our
legal system are adversarial in nature, e.g., Bond v. United
States, 564 U. S. 211, 217 (2011); Aetna Life Ins. Co. v.
Haworth, 300 U. S. 227, 240–241 (1937), but here, both
the habeas proceeding as a whole and the adjudication of
the specific issue of funding were adversarial. That the
habeas proceeding was adversarial is beyond dispute. And
on the funding question, petitioner and respondent plainly
have adverse interests and have therefore squared off as
adversaries. The motion for funding was formally noted
as “opposed” on the Disrict Court’s docket. App. 341. That
is not surprising: On one side, petitioner is seeking fund-
ing that he hopes will prevent his execution. On the other,
respondent wants to enforce the judgment of the Texas
courts and to do so without undue delay. Petitioner and
respondent have vigorously litigated the funding question
all the way to this Court.
   In arguing that the funding dispute is nonadversarial,
respondent attaches too much importance to the fact that
the request was made ex parte. As we have noted, the
“ex parte nature of a proceeding has not been thought to
imply that an act otherwise within a judge’s lawful juris-
diction was deprived of its judicial character.” Forrester v.
White, 484 U. S. 219, 227 (1988).
   In our adversary system, ex parte motions are disfa-
vored, but they have their place. See, e.g., Hohn, supra, at
248 (application for COA); Dalia v. United States, 441
U. S. 238, 255 (1979) (application for a search warrant); 50
U. S. C. §1805(a) (application to conduct electronic surveil-
lance for foreign intelligence); 18 U. S. C. §2518(3) (appli-
cations to intercept “wire, oral, or electronic communica-
tions”); 15 U. S. C. §1116(d)(1)(A) (application to seize
certain goods and counterfeit marks involved in violations
of the trademark laws); Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 17(b) (appli-
cation for witness subpoena); Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 47(c)
12                    AYESTAS v. DAVIS

                      Opinion of the Court

(generally recognizing ex parte motions and applications);
Ullmann v. United States, 350 U. S. 422, 423–424, 434
(1956) (application for an order granting a witness immun-
ity in exchange for self-incriminating testimony); United
States v. Monsanto, 491 U. S. 600, 603–604 (1989) (motion
to freeze defendant’s assets pending trial).
   Thus, the mere fact that a §3599 funding request may
sometimes be made ex parte is hardly dispositive. See
Hohn, 524 U. S., at 249; Tutun v. United States, 270 U. S.
568, 577 (1926).
                               C
  Respondent’s second argument is based on the vener-
able principle “that Congress cannot vest review of the
decisions of Article III courts in” entities other than “supe-
rior courts in the Article III hierarchy.” Plaut v. Spend-
thrift Farm, Inc., 514 U. S. 211, 218–219 (1995) (citing
Hayburn’s Case, 2 Dall. 409 (1792)). Respondent claims
that §3599 funding decisions may be revised by the Direc-
tor of the Administrative Office of the Courts and that this
shows that such decisions must be administrative. This
argument, however, rests on a faulty premise. Nothing in
§3599 even hints that review by the Director of the Ad-
ministrative Office is allowed.
  Respondent’s argument rests in part on a handful of old
lower court cases that appear to have accepted Adminis-
trative Office review of Criminal Justice Act of 1964 (CJA)
payments that had been authorized by a District Court
and approved by the chief judge of the relevant Circuit.
See United States v. Aadal, 282 F. Supp. 664, 665 (SDNY
1968); United States v. Gast, 297 F. Supp. 620, 621–622
(Del. 1969); see also United States v. Hunter, 385 F. Supp.
358, 362 (DC 1974). The basis for these decisions was a
provision of the CJA, 18 U. S. C. §3006A(h) (1964 ed.),
stating that CJA payments “shall be made under the
supervision of the Director of the Administrative Office of

                          Opinion of the Court

the United States Courts.”4
   It is not clear whether these decisions correctly inter-
preted the CJA,5 but in any event, no similar language
appears in §3599. And respondent has not identified a
single instance in which the Director of the Administrative
Office or any other nonjudicial officer has attempted to
review or alter a §3599 decision.
   Moreover, attorneys’ requests for CJA funds are mark-
edly different from the funding application at issue here.
Attorneys appointed under the CJA typically submit those
requests after the conclusion of the case, and the prosecu-
tion has no stake in the resolution of the matter. The
judgment in the criminal case cannot be affected by a
decision on compensation for services that have been
completed, and any funds awarded come out of the budget
of the Judiciary, not the Executive. See 18 U. S. C.
§3006A(i) (2012 ed.). Thus, the adversaries in the crimi-
nal case are not pitted against each other. In this case,
on the other hand, as we have explained, petitioner
and respondent have strong adverse interests.             For
these reasons, we reject respondent’s argument that the
adjudication of the funding issue is nonadversarial and
administrative.
   Respondent, however, claims that the funding decision
is administrative for an additional reason. “A §3599(f )
funding determination is properly deemed administra-
tive,” she contends, “because it . . . may be revised outside
the traditional Article III judicial hierarchy.” Brief for
Respondent 23. The basis for this argument is a provision
of §3599 stating that funding in excess of the generally

  4 This language now appears at 18 U. S. C. §3006A(i) (2012 ed.).
  5 As far as we are aware, neither the Administrative Office nor any
other nonjudicial entity currently claims the power to revise or reject a
CJA compensation order issued by a court. Nothing in the CJA Guide-
lines suggests such a policy. See generally 7A Guide to Judiciary Policy
(May 17, 2017).
14                    AYESTAS v. DAVIS

applicable statutory cap of $7,500 must be approved by the
chief judge of the circuit or another designated circuit
judge. §3599(g)(2). If a funding decision is judicial and
not administrative, respondent suggests, it could not be
reviewed by a single circuit judge as opposed to a panel of
three.
  This argument confuses what is familiar with what is
constitutionally required. Nothing in the Constitution ties
Congress to the typical structure of appellate review es-
tablished by statute. If Congress wishes to make certain
rulings reviewable by a single circuit judge, rather than a
panel of three, the Constitution does not stand in the way.
                             III
   Satisfied that we have jurisdiction, we turn to the ques-
tion whether the Court of Appeals applied the correct legal
standard when it affirmed the denial of petitioner’s fund-
ing request.
   Section 3599(a) authorizes federal courts to provide
funding to a party who is facing the prospect of a death
sentence and is “financially unable to obtain adequate
representation or investigative, expert, or other reason-
ably necessary services.” The statute applies to defendants
in federal cases, §3599(a)(1), as well as to state and federal
prisoners seeking collateral relief in federal court,
§3599(a)(2).
   Here we are concerned not with legal representation but
with services provided by experts, investigators, and the
like. Such services must be “reasonably necessary for the
representation of the [applicant]” in order to be eligible for
funding. §3599(f ). If the statutory standard is met, a
court “may authorize the [applicant’s] attorneys to obtain
such services on [his] behalf.” Ibid.
   The Fifth Circuit has held that individuals seeking
funding for such services must show that they have a
“substantial need” for the services. 817 F. 3d, at 896;
                 Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)           15

                     Opinion of the Court

Allen v. Stephens, 805 F. 3d 617, 626 (2015); Ward v.
Stephens, 777 F. 3d 250, 266, cert. denied, 577 U. S. ___
(2015). Petitioner contends that this interpretation is
more demanding than the standard—“reasonably neces-
sary”—set out in the statute. And although the difference
between the two formulations may not be great, petitioner
has a point.
   In the strictest sense of the term, something is “neces-
sary” only if it is essential. See Webster’s Third New
International Dictionary 1510 (1993) (something is neces-
sary if it “must be by reason of the nature of things,” if it
“cannot be otherwise by reason of inherent qualities”); 10
Oxford English Dictionary 275–276 (2d ed. 1989) (OED)
(defining the adjective “necessary” to mean “essential”).
But in ordinary speech, the term is often used more loosely
to refer to something that is merely important or strongly
desired. (“I need a vacation.” “I need to catch up with an
old friend.”) The term is sometimes used in a similar way
in the law. The term “necessary” in the Necessary and
Proper Clause does not mean “absolutely necessary,”
McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 414–415 (1819),
and a “necessary” business expense under the Internal
Revenue Code, 26 U. S. C. §162(a), may be an expense
that is merely helpful and appropriate, Commissioner v.
Tellier, 383 U. S. 687, 689 (1966). As Black’s Law Diction-
ary puts it, the term “may import absolute physical neces-
sity or inevitability, or it may import that which is only
convenient, useful, appropriate, suitable, proper, or condu-
cive to the end sought.” Black’s Law Dictionary 928 (5th
ed. 1979) (Black’s).
   Section 3599 appears to use the term “necessary” to
mean something less than essential. The provision applies
to services that are “reasonably necessary,” but it makes
little sense to refer to something as being “reasonably
essential.” What the statutory phrase calls for, we con-
clude, is a determination by the district court, in the exer-
16                   AYESTAS v. DAVIS

                     Opinion of the Court

cise of its discretion, as to whether a reasonable attorney
would regard the services as sufficiently important, guided
by the considerations we set out more fully below.
   The Fifth Circuit’s test—“substantial need”—is arguably
more demanding. We may assume that the term “need” is
comparable to “necessary”—that is, that something is
“needed” if it is “necessary.” But the term “substantial”
suggests a heavier burden than the statutory term “rea-
sonably.” Compare 13 OED 291 (defining “reasonably” to
mean, among other things, “[s]ufficiently, suitably, fairly”;
“[f ]airly or pretty well”) with 17 id., at 66–67 (defining
“substantial,” with respect to “reasons, causes, evidence,”
to mean “firmly or solidly established”); see also Black’s
1456 (10th ed. 2014) (defining “reasonable” to mean
“[f ]air, proper, or moderate under the circumstances . . .
See plausible”); id., at 1656 (defining “substantial” to
mean, among other things, “[i]mportant, essential, and
material”).
   The difference between “reasonably necessary” and
“substantially need[ed]” may be small, but the Fifth Cir-
cuit exacerbated the problem by invoking precedent to the
effect that a habeas petitioner seeking funding must pre-
sent “a viable constitutional claim that is not procedurally
barred.” 817 F. 3d, at 895 (internal quotation marks
omitted). See also, e.g., Riley v. Dretke, 362 F. 3d 302, 307
(CA5 2004) (“A petitioner cannot show a substantial need
when his claim is procedurally barred from review”);
Allen, supra, at 638–639 (describing “ ‘our rule that a
prisoner cannot show a substantial need for funds when
his claim is procedurally barred from review’ ” (quoting
Crutsinger v. Stephens, 576 Fed. Appx. 422, 431 (CA5
2014) (per curiam)); Ward, supra, at 266 (“The denial of
funding will be upheld . . . when the constitutional claim is
procedurally barred”).
   The Fifth Circuit adopted this rule before our decision in
Trevino, but after Trevino, the rule is too restrictive.
                  Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)           17

                      Opinion of the Court

Trevino permits a Texas prisoner to overcome the failure
to raise a substantial ineffective-assistance claim in state
court by showing that state habeas counsel was ineffec-
tive, 569 U. S., at 429, and it is possible that investigation
might enable a petitioner to carry that burden. In those
cases in which funding stands a credible chance of ena-
bling a habeas petitioner to overcome the obstacle of pro-
cedural default, it may be error for a district court to
refuse funding.
   Congress has made it clear, however, that district courts
have broad discretion in assessing requests for funding.
Section 3599’s predecessor declared that district courts
“shall authorize” funding for services deemed “reasonably
necessary.” 21 U. S. C. §848(q)(9) (1988 ed.). Applying
this provision, courts of appeals reviewed district court
funding decisions for abuse of discretion. E.g., Bonin v.
Calderon, 59 F. 3d 815, 837 (CA9 1995); In re Lindsey, 875
F. 2d 1502, 1507, n. 4 (CA11 1989); United States v. Alden,
767 F. 2d 314, 319 (CA7 1984). Then, as part of the Anti-
terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 110
Stat. 1226, Congress changed the verb from “shall” to
“may,” and thus made it perfectly clear that determining
whether funding is “reasonably necessary” is a decision as
to which district courts enjoy broad discretion. See King-
domware Technologies, Inc. v. United States, 579 U. S. ___,
___ (2016) (slip op., at 9).
   A natural consideration informing the exercise of that
discretion is the likelihood that the contemplated services
will help the applicant win relief. After all, the proposed
services must be “reasonably necessary” for the applicant’s
representation, and it would not be reasonable—in fact, it
would be quite unreasonable—to think that services are
necessary to the applicant’s representation if, realistically
speaking, they stand little hope of helping him win relief.
Proper application of the “reasonably necessary” standard
thus requires courts to consider the potential merit of the
18                    AYESTAS v. DAVIS

                      Opinion of the Court

claims that the applicant wants to pursue, the likelihood
that the services will generate useful and admissible
evidence, and the prospect that the applicant will be able
to clear any procedural hurdles standing in the way.
    To be clear, a funding applicant must not be expected to
prove that he will be able to win relief if given the services
he seeks. But the “reasonably necessary” test requires an
assessment of the likely utility of the services requested,
and §3599(f ) cannot be read to guarantee that an appli-
cant will have enough money to turn over every stone.
    Petitioner does not deny this. He agrees that an appli-
cant must “articulat[e] specific reasons why the services
are warranted”—which includes demonstrating that the
underlying claim is at least “ ‘plausible’ ”—and he
acknowledges that there may even be cases in which it
would be within a court’s discretion to “deny funds after a
finding of ‘reasonable necessity.’ ” Brief for Petitioner 43.
    These interpretive principles are consistent with the
way in which §3599’s predecessors were read by the lower
courts. See, e.g., Alden, supra, at 318–319 (explaining
that it was “appropriate for the district court to satisfy
itself that [the] defendant may have a plausible defense
before granting the defendant’s . . . motion for psychiatric
assistance to aid in that defense,” and that it is not proper
to use the funding statute to subsidize a “ ‘fishing expedi-
tion’ ”); United States v. Hamlet, 480 F. 2d 556, 557 (CA5
1973) (per curiam) (upholding District Court’s refusal to
fund psychiatric services based on the District Court’s
conclusion that “the request for psychiatric services was
. . . lacking in merit” because there was “no serious possi-
bility that appellant was legally insane at any time perti-
nent to the crimes committed”). This abundance of prece-
dent shows courts have plenty of experience making the
determinations that §3599(f ) contemplates.

                             IV
   Perhaps anticipating that we might not accept the Fifth
Circuit’s reading of §3599(f ), respondent devotes a sub-
stantial portion of her brief to an alternative ground for
affirmance that was neither presented nor passed on
below.
   Respondent contends that whatever “reasonably neces-
sary” means, funding is never “reasonably necessary” in a
case like this one, where a habeas petitioner seeks to
present a procedurally defaulted ineffective-assistance-of-
trial-counsel claim that depends on facts outside the state-
court record. Citing 28 U. S. C. §2254(e)(2), respondent
contends that the fruits of any such investigation would be
inadmissible in a federal habeas court.
   We decline to decide in the first instance whether re-
spondent’s reading of §2254(e)(2) is correct. Petitioner
agrees that the argument remains open for the Fifth
Circuit to consider on remand. Tr. of Oral Arg. 6.
                        *    *     *
  We conclude that the Fifth Circuit’s interpretation of
§3599(f ) is not a permissible reading of the statute. We
therefore vacate the judgment below and remand the case
for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

                                                  It is so ordered.

 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT

                        [March 21, 2018]


    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG
joins, concurring.
    The Court correctly concludes that the Fifth Circuit
applied the wrong legal standard in evaluating a request
for funding for investigative services under 18 U. S. C.
§3599(f ). That should come as no surprise, as the Fifth
Circuit required capital habeas petitioners to show a
“ ‘substantial need’ ” for services, when the statute requires
only a showing that the services are “ ‘reasonably neces-
sary.’ ” Ante, at 16. “Substantial,” of course, imposes a
higher burden than “reasonable.” Ante, at 16. The Fifth
Circuit “exacerbated the problem” by requiring a showing
of “a viable constitutional claim that is not procedurally
barred,” which ignores “that investigation might enable a
petitioner . . . to overcome the obstacle of procedural de-
fault.” Ante, at 16–17 (internal quotation marks omitted).
I therefore join the opinion of the Court in full holding
that to satisfy §3599(f ), a petitioner need only show that
“a reasonable attorney would regard the services as suffi-
ciently important.” Ante, at 16.
    Having answered the question presented of what is the
appropriate §3599(f ) standard, the Court remands Ayes-
tas’ case for the lower courts to consider the application of

the standard in the first instance. Ante, at 19.1 I write
separately to explain why, on the record before this Court,
there should be little doubt that Ayestas has satisfied
§3599(f ).
                               I
   At the center of the §3599(f ) funding request in this
case is Ayestas’ claim that his trial counsel was ineffective
for failing to investigate mitigation. Specifically, Ayestas
claims that his trial counsel was deficient in failing to
conduct an investigation of his mental health and sub-
stance abuse, which could have been presented at the
penalty phase of the trial to convince the jury to spare his
life. As the Court notes, however, Ayestas faces a hurdle
in presenting this ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel
claim in his federal habeas petition, as his state postcon-
viction counsel never presented that claim in the Texas
collateral proceedings. See ante, at 5.
   To overcome that procedural default, Ayestas relies on
Martinez v. Ryan, 566 U. S. 1 (2012), and Trevino v. Thaler,
569 U. S. 413 (2013). In those cases, this Court recognized
a “particular concern” in the application of a procedural
default rule that would prevent a petitioner from “pre-
sent[ing] a claim of trial error,” especially “when the claim
is one of ineffective assistance of counsel.” Martinez, 566
U. S., at 12. “The right to the effective assistance of coun-
sel,” the Court reasoned, “is a bedrock principle in our
justice system.” Ibid. The Court thus held that where the
“state procedural framework, by reason of its design and
operation, makes it highly unlikely in a typical case that a
defendant will have a meaningful opportunity to raise a
claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel on direct
appeal,” then “ ‘a procedural default will not bar a federal

vanced that were neither presented nor passed on below. Ante, at 19.

habeas court from hearing a substantial claim of ineffec-
tive assistance at trial if, in the initial-review collateral
proceeding, there was no counsel or counsel . . . was inef-
fective.’ ” Trevino, 569 U. S., at 429 (quoting Martinez, 566
U. S., at 17; alteration omitted).2
   Therefore, the fact that Ayestas’ postconviction counsel
failed to raise his ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel
claim in state court does not bar federal review of that
claim if Ayestas can show that the “attorney in his first
collateral proceeding was ineffective” and that “his claim
of ineffective assistance of trial counsel is substantial.”
Id., at 18. The substantiality of the ineffective-assistance-
of-trial-counsel claim and the ineffectiveness of postconvic-
tion counsel are both analyzed under the familiar frame-
work set out in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668
(1984). “Ineffective assistance under Strickland is defi-
cient performance by counsel resulting in prejudice, with
performance being measured against an objective standard
of reasonableness.” Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U. S. 374, 380
(2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
   Remember, however, the specific context in which inef-
fective assistance is being considered in Ayestas’ case: a
request under §3599(f ) for investigative services, which
requires a showing only that “a reasonable attorney would
regard the services as sufficiently important.” Ante, at 16.
Ayestas is not “expected to prove that he will be able to
win relief if given the services he seeks.” Ante, at 18

——————
  2 The reason for this exception is evident. Excusing the procedural

default “acknowledges, as an equitable matter, that the initial-review
collateral proceeding, if undertaken without counsel or with ineffective
counsel, may not have been sufficient.” Martinez, 566 U. S., at 14.
“Claims of ineffective assistance at trial often require investigative
work and an understanding of trial strategy,” and “the prisoner is in no
position to develop the evidentiary basis for a claim of ineffective
assistance, which often turns on evidence outside the trial record.” Id.,
at 11–12; see also Trevino, 569 U. S., at 423–424, 428.

                      SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring

(emphasis in original). A court simply must consider at
this stage “the potential merit of the claims that the appli-
cant wants to pursue, the likelihood that the services will
generate useful and admissible evidence, and the prospect
that the applicant will be able to clear any procedural
hurdles standing in the way.” Ante, at 17–18. Thus, the
inquiry is not whether Ayestas can prove that his trial
counsel was ineffective under Strickland or whether he
will succeed in overcoming the procedural default under
Martinez and Trevino. Rather, at this §3599(f ) request
stage, the focus is on the potential merit of these claims.
                             II

                             A

  With this framework in mind, the focus first is on the
evidence of the deficient performance of Ayestas’ state-
appointed counsel.3 Trial counsel secured the appoint-
ment of an investigator, who met with Ayestas shortly
after the appointment. For nearly 15 months, however,
there was apparently no investigation into Ayestas’ history
in preparation for trial. Counsel instructed the investi-
gator “to resume investigation” only about a month before
jury selection. Record 878. The investigator then subpoe-
naed psychological and disciplinary prison records and
had Ayestas fill out a questionnaire, in response to which
Ayestas revealed that he had experienced multiple head
traumas and had a history of substance abuse. Jail rec-
ords also noted a rules infraction for possession of home-
made intoxicants. Trial counsel never followed up on any
of this information, sought further related records, or had
Ayestas evaluated by a mental health professional.
  About two weeks before jury selection, trial counsel for
the first time reached out to Ayestas’ family in Honduras.

——————
  3 The State appointed two attorneys to represent Ayestas at trial. I

refer to them together as “trial counsel.”

                      SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring

Shortly thereafter, five days before trial, counsel wrote
Ayestas’ family stating that she needed them to come
testify. Ayestas’ family agreed, but they indicated that
they could not obtain visas because a letter that trial
counsel was supposed to have sent to the U. S. Embassy to
facilitate their travel never arrived, and ultimately no
family members appeared at Ayestas’ trial.
   The guilt phase lasted two days, and trial counsel pre-
sented no witnesses. The penalty phase lasted less than a
day, and trial counsel presented two minutes of mitigation
evidence consisting of three letters from an instructor who
taught English classes to Ayestas in prison, attesting that
he was “a serious and attentive student.” App. 41–43.4
   On this record, Ayestas has made a strong showing that
trial counsel was deficient. “It is unquestioned that under
the prevailing professional norms at the time of [Ayestas’]
trial, counsel had an obligation to conduct a thorough
investigation of [his] background.” Porter v. McCollum,
558 U. S. 30, 39 (2009) (per curiam) (internal quotation
marks omitted). Here, Ayestas’ trial counsel “clearly did
not satisfy those norms.” Ibid. With a client facing a
possible death sentence, counsel and her investigator did
not start looking into Ayestas’ personal history until the
eve of trial. The little the investigator uncovered—head
trauma and a history of substance abuse—should have
prompted further inquiry. Yet trial counsel did nothing.
Even if Ayestas prohibited counsel from contacting his
family in Honduras until the start of trial was imminent,
see ante, at 3,5 that still would not explain why counsel
——————
  4 Trial counsel also attempted to introduce evidence that Ayestas had

no criminal history in Honduras, but failed to link Ayestas to the
records, which were under his given name, “Dennis Zelaya Corea.” See
Ayestas v. Stephens, 817 F. 3d 888, 892, n. 1 (CA5 2016) (per curiam).
  5 During postconviction proceedings, trial counsel filed an affidavit

asserting that Ayestas did not allow contact with his family in Hondu-
ras until after jury selection had commenced. When the record evi-
6                         AYESTAS v. DAVIS

                       SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring

failed to perform any other mitigation investigation, see
Porter, 558 U. S., at 40 (noting that even if the defendant
is “uncooperative, . . . that does not obviate the need for
defense counsel to conduct some sort of mitigation investi-
gation (emphasis in original)). In the end, the decision to
sentence Ayestas to death was made in less than one day,
and his counsel spent less than two minutes presenting
mitigation to the jury. Two minutes.
  This Court has recognized that the decision not to pre-
sent mitigation may be supported in certain cases by
“strategic judgments,” provided the reviewing court is
satisfied with “the adequacy of the investigations support-
ing those judgments.” Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510,
521 (2003). But this does not appear to be one of those
cases. There is nothing in the record that would support
the conclusion that counsel chose the two-minutes-of-
mitigation strategy after careful investigation and consid-
eration of Ayestas’ case. Instead, counsel for the most part
“did not even take the first step of interviewing witnesses
or requesting records” and “ignored pertinent avenues for
investigation of which [they] should have been aware.”
Porter, 558 U. S., at 39–40.
  In evaluating the potential merit of Ayestas’ claim, the
Fifth Circuit misapplied Strickland and the §3599(f )
standard. It reasoned that Ayestas had not presented a
viable claim that trial counsel was deficient in failing to
investigate Ayestas’ mental illness because, as he was not
diagnosed with schizophrenia until his time in prison,
there was nothing that flagged mental illness issues prior
to trial.6 See Ayestas v. Stephens, 817 F. 3d 888, 895–897
——————
dence contradicted that assertion, counsel submitted another affidavit
with a revised timeline. Ayestas disputes having instructed trial
counsel not to contact his family in Honduras.
  6 It is unclear whether the Fifth Circuit ultimately relied on its de-

termination that trial counsel was not deficient in rejecting Ayestas’
claims. In its panel opinion, it incorrectly stated that trial counsel had
                     Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)                   7

                      SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring

(2016) (per curiam). The absence of a documented diagno-
sis, however, did not excuse trial counsel from their “obli-
gation to conduct a thorough investigation of [Ayestas’]
background.” Porter, 558 U. S., at 39 (internal quotation
marks omitted). In fact, the obligation to investigate
exists in part precisely because it is all too common for
individuals to go years battling an undiagnosed and un-
treated mental illness.
   In any event, the Fifth Circuit failed to consider that
one of the purposes of the §3599(f ) investigation was to
look at Ayestas’ life around the time of the crime and trial
to determine if there were mitigating circumstances that
trial counsel could have discovered, such as whether
symptoms of his schizophrenia had begun to manifest even
before his diagnosis. The Court makes clear today that in
evaluating §3599(f ) funding requests, courts must consider
“the likelihood that the services will generate useful and
admissible evidence.” Ante, at 17. It was error, therefore,
for the Fifth Circuit to evaluate the merit of the ineffec-
tive-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim and to deny §3599(f )
funding based solely on an evaluation of the evidence in
the record at the time of the request, without evaluating
the potential evidence that Ayestas sought. Ante, at
17–18.
                             B
  The evidence concerning the deficiency of Ayestas’ state
postconviction counsel is similarly strong. State postcon-
viction counsel retained the services of a mitigation spe-
cialist, who prepared an investigation plan noting that it
——————
conducted a psychological evaluation of Ayestas. 817 F. 3d, at 897.
After Ayestas corrected the record in his petition for rehearing, the
panel issued an order reaffirming its holding, relying on its finding of
no prejudice. See Ayestas v. Stephens, 826 F. 3d 214, 215 (2016) ( per
curiam). Still, the Fifth Circuit never disavowed its conclusion regard-
ing trial-counsel deficiency. Ibid.
8                     AYESTAS v. DAVIS

                   SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring

was “obvious no social history investigation was conducted”
and that the jury had “heard nothing about [Ayestas’] . . .
mental health, possible mental illness, [or] substance
abuse history.” App. 81, 266. The plan also noted that it
was “clear that [Ayestas] had a history of substance
abuse.” Record 721; see also App. 267. The specialist
recommended a comprehensive investigation into Ayestas’
biological, psychological, and social history to explore,
inter alia, issues related to addiction and mental health.
   State postconviction counsel failed to follow these rec-
ommendations. He did nothing to investigate issues related
to Ayestas’ mental health or substance abuse. Notably,
Ayestas suffered a psychotic episode and was diagnosed
with schizophrenia while his state postconviction applica-
tion was pending. Moreover, in 2003, a counsel-arranged
evaluation pursuant Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U. S. 304
(2002), noted concerns about Ayestas’ “delusional think-
ing.” App. 139–140. These events still did not prompt
counsel to investigate Ayestas’ mental health history.
   Instead, state postconviction counsel explored the cir-
cumstances of Ayestas’ arrest, conducted some juror inter-
views, and interviewed Ayestas’ mother and sisters, ob-
taining affidavits regarding Ayestas’ upbringing in
Honduras and their interactions with trial counsel. Post-
conviction counsel eventually filed an application that
contained a narrow claim of ineffective assistance of trial
counsel with respect to mitigation regarding the attorneys’
failure to secure the attendance of Ayestas’ family mem-
bers at trial. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals denied
the application, relying on the affidavit submitted by trial
counsel, see n. 4, supra, to find no ineffectiveness in failing
to get Ayestas’ family to attend trial.
   The Fifth Circuit concluded that Ayestas’ state postcon-
viction counsel was not ineffective because, in its view,
Ayestas had not established any deficiency at trial in the
failure to investigate mental health and substance abuse
                 Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)            9

                   SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring

mitigation. See 817 F. 3d, at 898. That conclusion, as
noted in Part II–A, supra, was based on a misapplication
of Strickland and the §3599(f ) standard, and thus cannot
support a finding that the failure to present the claim in
postconviction proceedings was “strategic.” 817 F. 3d, at
898. Nor is there anything else in the record that would
excuse that deficiency. State postconviction counsel ig-
nored his own mitigation specialist, who alerted him to a
serious failing in the trial because the jury heard virtually
no mitigation and to the serious failings of trial counsel
because of the failure to conduct a social history investiga-
tion of Ayestas. Even after Ayestas’ psychotic episode,
schizophrenia diagnosis, and documented tendencies of
“delusional thinking” during the course of the representa-
tion, state postconviction counsel did nothing. As with
trial counsel, the record provides no support for any “stra-
tegic justification” to disregard completely a mitigation
investigation of Ayestas’ mental health and substance
abuse.
                             III
   Strickland next requires consideration of prejudice. To
establish prejudice, this Court has held that a “defendant
must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but
for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the pro-
ceeding would have been different,” meaning “a probabil-
ity sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.”
466 U. S., at 694. In cases alleging a failure to investigate
mitigation, as here, the Court must “reweigh the evidence
in aggravation against the totality of available mitigating
evidence.” Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 534.
   Even with the scant evidence in the record at this time
as to what Ayestas could have presented to the jury in the
form of mitigation, Ayestas has made a strong showing
that his claim has potential merit. That trial counsel
presented only two minutes of mitigation already goes a
10                      AYESTAS v. DAVIS

                     SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring

long way to establishing prejudice.           In fact, the State
emphasized to the jury at sentencing:
     “Does he have anything there that would lead you to
     conclude there is some type of mitigation, anything at
     all? There is no drug problem . . . no health problem
     . . . no alcohol problem. . . . [O]nly . . . these three pieces
     of paper . . . . Making steps to learn a second lan-
     guage does not lessen his moral blameworthiness
     . . . .” Record 4747.
The State, in contrast, presented evidence of Ayestas’
criminal history as well as victim impact testimony. After
deliberating for only 25 minutes, the jury assessed a pun-
ishment of death against Ayestas, finding that he was a
future danger, that he intended to cause death or antici-
pated the loss of life, and that there were no mitigating
circumstances that warranted imposition of a life sentence
over a death sentence. Had just one juror dissented on a
single one of these findings, no death sentence could have
been imposed. See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art.
37.071, §2(g) (Vernon Cum. Supp. 2017); see also ante, at
2. With even minimal investigation by trial counsel, at
least one may well have, as this Court has held that evi-
dence of mental illness and substance abuse is relevant to
assessing moral culpability. See Rompilla, 545 U. S., at
393; Porter, 558 U. S., at 43–44. Instead, the jury “heard
almost nothing that would humanize [him] or allow them
to accurately gauge his moral culpability.” Id., at 41.
There is thus good reason to believe that, were Ayestas’
§3599(f ) motion granted, he could establish prejudice
under Strickland.
   The Fifth Circuit held otherwise based on its belief that
no amount of mitigation would have changed the outcome
of the sentencing given the “brutality of the crime.” 817
F. 3d, at 898. That “brutality of the crime” rationale is
simply contrary to our directive in case after case that, in
                     Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)                    11

                       SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring

assessing prejudice, a court must “consider the totality of
the available mitigation evidence . . . and reweigh it
against the evidence in aggravation.” Porter, 558 U. S., at
41 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted); see
also Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 397–398 (2000);
Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 534. By considering aggravation in
isolation, the Fifth Circuit directly contravened this fun-
damental principle.7
                              IV
  In sum, Ayestas has made a strong showing that he is
entitled to §3599(f ) funding. As the Court notes, the
statute affords district courts some discretion in these
funding determinations, even where a petitioner shows
the services are “ ‘reasonably necessary.’ ” Ante, at 17–18.
Exercise of that discretion may be appropriate if there is a
showing of gamesmanship or where the State has provided
funding for the same investigation services, as Ayestas
conceded at argument. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 13. Nonethe-
less, the troubling failures of counsel at both the trial and
state postconviction stages of Ayestas’ case are exactly the
types of facts that should prompt courts to afford investi-
gatory services to ensure that trial errors that go to a
“bedrock principle in our justice system” do not go un-
addressed. Martinez, 566 U. S., at 12.




——————
  7 Notably, application of this “brutality of the crime” rule is particu-

larly irrational in the §3599(f ) context, where the court is unaware of
what the undiscovered evidence of mitigation looks like.

                 MARINELLO v. UNITED STATES

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT

   No. 16–1144. Argued December 6, 2017—Decided March 21, 2018
Between 2004 and 2009, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) intermit-
  tently investigated petitioner Marinello’s tax activities. In 2012, the
  Government indicted Marinello for violating, among other criminal
  tax statutes, a provision in </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">26</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §7212(a) known as the Omni-
  bus Clause, which forbids “corruptly or by force or threats of force . . .
  obstruct[ing] or imped[ing], or endeavor[ing] to obstruct or impede,
  the due administration of [the Internal Revenue Code].” The judge
  instructed the jury that, to convict Marinello of an Omnibus Clause
  violation, it must find that he “corruptly” engaged in at least one of
  eight specified activities, but the jury was not told that it needed to
  find that Marinello knew he was under investigation and intended
  corruptly to interfere with that investigation. Marinello was convict-
  ed. The Second Circuit affirmed, rejecting his claim that an Omnibus
  Clause violation requires the Government to show the defendant
  tried to interfere with a pending IRS proceeding, such as a particular
  investigation.
Held: To convict a defendant under the Omnibus Clause, the Govern-
  ment must prove the defendant was aware of a pending tax-related
  proceeding, such as a particular investigation or audit, or could rea-
  sonably foresee that such a proceeding would commence. Pp. 3–11.
     (a) In United States v. Aguilar, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""117962""><a href=""/opinion/117962/united-states-v-aguilar/""><span class=""volume"">515</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">593</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, this Court interpret-
  ed a similarly worded criminal statute—which made it a felony “cor-
  ruptly or by threats or force . . . [to] influenc[e], obstruc[t], or
  imped[e], or endeavo[r] to influence, obstruct, or impede, the due ad-
  ministration of justice,” </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">18</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §1503(a). There, the Court re-
  quired the Government to show there was a “nexus” between the de-
  fendant’s obstructive conduct and a particular judicial proceeding.
  The Court said that the defendant’s “act must have a relationship in
2                   MARINELLO v. UNITED STATES

                                  Syllabus

    time, causation, or logic with the judicial proceedings.” 515 U. S., at
    599. In reaching this conclusion, the Court emphasized that it has
    “traditionally exercised restraint in assessing the reach of a federal
    criminal statute, both out of deference to the prerogatives of Congress
    and out of concern that ‘a fair warning should be given to the world
    in language that the common world will understand, of what the law
    intends to do if a certain line is passed.’ ” Id., at 600. That reasoning
    applies here with similar strength. The verbs “obstruct” and “im-
    pede” require an object. The taxpayer must hinder a particular per-
    son or thing. The object in §7212(a) is the “due administration of [the
    Tax Code].” That phrase is best viewed, like the “due administration
    of justice” in Aguilar, as referring to discrete targeted administrative
    acts rather than every conceivable task involved in the Tax Code’s
    administration. Statutory context confirms this reading. The Omni-
    bus Clause appears in the middle of a sentence that refers to efforts
    to “intimidate or impede any officer or employee of the United States
    acting in an official capacity.” §7212(a). The first part of the sen-
    tence also refers to “force or threats of force,” which the statute else-
    where defines as “threats of bodily harm to the officer or employee of
    the United States or to a member of his family.” Ibid. And §7212(b)
    refers to the “forcibl[e] rescu[e]” of “any property after it shall have
    been seized under” the Internal Revenue Code. Subsections (a) and
    (b) thus refer to corrupt or forceful actions taken against individual
    identifiable persons or property. In context, the Omnibus Clause log-
    ically serves as a “catchall” for the obstructive conduct the subsection
    sets forth, not for every violation that interferes with routine admin-
    istrative procedures such as the processing of tax returns, receipt of
    tax payments, or issuance of tax refunds. The statute’s legislative
    history does not suggest otherwise. The broader context of the full
    Internal Revenue Code also counsels against a broad reading. Inter-
    preting the Omnibus Clause to apply to all Code administration could
    transform the Code’s numerous misdemeanor provisions into felonies,
    making them redundant or perhaps the subject matter of plea bar-
    gaining. It could also result in a similar lack of fair warning and re-
    lated kinds of unfairness that led this Court to “exercise” interpretive
    “restraint” in Aguilar. See 515 U. S., at 600. The Government claims
    that the “corrupt state of mind” requirement will cure any over-
    breadth problem, but it is difficult to imagine a scenario when that
    requirement will make a practical difference in the context of federal
    tax prosecutions. And to rely on prosecutorial discretion to narrow
    the otherwise wide-ranging scope of a criminal statute’s general lan-
    guage places too much power in the prosecutor’s hands. Pp. 3–9.
       (b) Following the same approach taken in similar cases, the Gov-
    ernment here must show that there is a “nexus” between the defend-

  ant’s conduct and a particular administrative proceeding, such as an
  investigation, an audit, or other targeted administrative action. See
  Aguilar, supra, at 599. The term “particular administrative proceed-
  ing” does not mean every act carried out by IRS employees in the
  course of their administration of the Tax Code. Just because a tax-
  payer knows that the IRS will review her tax return annually does
  not transform every Tax Code violation into an obstruction charge.
  In addition to satisfying the nexus requirement, the Government
  must show that the proceeding was pending at the time the defend-
  ant engaged in the obstructive conduct or, at the least, was then rea-
  sonably foreseeable by the defendant. See Arthur Andersen LLP v.

 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

           APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT

                                [March 21, 2018]


  JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.
  A clause in §7212(a) of the Internal Revenue Code
makes it a felony “corruptly or by force” to “endeavo[r] to
obstruct or imped[e] the due administration of this title.”
</pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">26</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §7212(a). The question here concerns the
breadth of that statutory phrase. Does it cover virtually
all governmental efforts to collect taxes? Or does it have a
narrower scope? In our view, “due administration of [the
Tax Code]” does not cover routine administrative proce-
dures that are near-universally applied to all taxpayers,
such as the ordinary processing of income tax returns.
Rather, the clause as a whole refers to specific interference
with targeted governmental tax-related proceedings, such
as a particular investigation or audit.
                               I
  The Internal Revenue Code provision at issue, §7212(a),
has two substantive clauses. The first clause, which we
shall call the “Officer Clause,” forbids
    “corruptly or by force or threats of force (including any
    threatening letter or communication) endeavor[ing] to
    intimidate or impede any officer or employee of the
2              MARINELLO v. UNITED STATES

                      Opinion of the Court

    United States acting in an official capacity under [the
    Internal Revenue Code].” Ibid. (emphasis added).
The second clause, which we shall call the “Omnibus
Clause,” forbids
    “corruptly or by force or threats of force (including any
    threatening letter or communication) obstruct[ing] or
    imped[ing], or endeavor[ing] to obstruct or impede, the
    due administration of [the Internal Revenue Code].”
    Ibid. (emphasis added).
As we said at the outset, we here consider the scope of the
Omnibus Clause. (We have placed the full text of §7212 in
the Appendix, infra.)
    Between 2004 and 2009, the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) opened, then closed, then reopened an investigation
into the tax activities of Carlo Marinello, the petitioner
here. In 2012 the Government indicted Marinello, charg-
ing him with violations of several criminal tax statutes
including the Omnibus Clause. In respect to the Omnibus
Clause the Government claimed that Marinello had en-
gaged in at least one of eight different specified activities,
including “failing to maintain corporate books and rec-
ords,” “failing to provide” his tax accountant “with com-
plete and accurate” tax “information,” “destroying . . .
business records,” “hiding income,” and “paying employees
. . . with cash.” </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">839</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.3d</span> <span class=""page"">209</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 213 (CA2 2016).
    Before the jury retired to consider the charges, the judge
instructed it that, to convict Marinello of violating the
Omnibus Clause, it must find unanimously that he en-
gaged in at least one of the eight practices just mentioned,
that the jurors need not agree on which one, and that he
did so “corruptly,” meaning “with the intent to secure an
unlawful advantage or benefit, either for [himself] or for
another.” App. in No. 15–2224 (CA2), p. 432. The judge,
however, did not instruct the jury that it must find that
Marinello knew he was under investigation and intended

                     Opinion of the Court

corruptly to interfere with that investigation. The jury
subsequently convicted Marinello on all counts.
   Marinello appealed to the Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit. He argued, among other things, that a
violation of the Omnibus Clause requires the Government
to show that the defendant had tried to interfere with a
“pending IRS proceeding,” such as a particular investiga-
tion. Brief for Appellant in No. 15–2224, pp. 23–25. The
appeals court disagreed. It held that a defendant need not
possess “ ‘an awareness of a particular [IRS] action or
investigation.’ ” </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">839</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.</span> <span class=""page"">3d</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, at 221 (quoting United States v.
Wood, 384 Fed. Appx. 698, 704 (CA2 2010); alteration in
original). The full Court of Appeals rejected Marinello’s
petition for rehearing, two judges dissenting. </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">855</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.3d</span>
<span class=""page"">455</span></span><pre class=""inline""> (CA2 2017).
   Marinello then petitioned for certiorari, asking us to
decide whether the Omnibus Clause requires the Govern-
ment to prove the defendant was aware of “a pending IRS
action or proceeding, such as an investigation or audit,”
when he “engaged in the purportedly obstructive conduct.”
Pet. for Cert. i. In light of a division of opinion among the
Circuits on this point, we granted the petition. Compare

                             II
  In United States v. Aguilar, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""117962""><a href=""/opinion/117962/united-states-v-aguilar/""><span class=""volume"">515</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">593</span></a></span><pre class=""inline""> (1995), we
interpreted a similarly worded criminal statute. That
statute made it a felony “corruptly or by threats or force,
or by any threatening letter or communication, [to] influ-
enc[e], obstruc[t], or imped[e], or endeavo[r] to influence,
obstruct, or impede, the due administration of justice.” </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">18</span>
<span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §1503(a). The statute concerned not (as here) “the
due administration of ” the Internal Revenue Code but
rather “the due administration of justice.” (We have
4              MARINELLO v. UNITED STATES

                     Opinion of the Court

placed the full text of §1503 in the Appendix, infra.)
   In interpreting that statute we pointed to earlier cases
in which courts had held that the Government must prove
“an intent to influence judicial or grand jury proceedings.”
Aguilar, supra, at 599 (citing United States v. Brown, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">688</span>
<span class=""reporter"">F.2d</span> <span class=""page"">596</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 598 (CA9 1982)). We noted that some courts
had imposed a “ ‘nexus’ requirement”: that the defendant’s
“act must have a relationship in time, causation, or logic
with the judicial proceedings.” Aguilar, supra, at 599
(citing United States v. Wood, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""654277""><a href=""/opinion/654277/united-states-v-paul-d-wood/""><span class=""volume"">6</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.3d</span> <span class=""page"">692</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 696 (CA10
1993), and United States v. Walasek, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""331814""><a href=""/opinion/331814/united-states-v-paul-walasek/""><span class=""volume"">527</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.2d</span> <span class=""page"">676</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">,
679, and n. 12 (CA3 1975)). And we adopted the same
requirement.
   We set forth two important reasons for doing so. We
wrote that we “have traditionally exercised restraint in
assessing the reach of a federal criminal statute, both out
of deference to the prerogatives of Congress and out of
concern that ‘a fair warning should be given to the world
in language that the common world will understand, of
what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed.’ ”
Aguilar, supra, at 600 (quoting McBoyle v. United States,
</pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""101695""><a href=""/opinion/101695/mcboyle-v-united-states/""><span class=""volume"">283</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">25</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 27 (1931); citation omitted). Both reasons
apply here with similar strength.
   As to Congress’ intent, the literal language of the stat-
ute is neutral. The statutory words “obstruct or impede”
are broad. They can refer to anything that “block[s],”
“make[s] difficult,” or “hinder[s].” Black’s Law Dictionary
1246 (10th ed. 2014) (obstruct); Webster’s New Interna-
tional Dictionary (Webster’s) 1248 (2d ed. 1954) (impede);
id., at 1682 (obstruct); accord, 5 Oxford English Dictionary
80 (1933) (impede); 7 id., at 36 (obstruct). But the verbs
“obstruct” and “impede” suggest an object—the taxpayer
must hinder a particular person or thing. Here, the object
is the “due administration of this title.” The word “admin-
istration” can be read literally to refer to every “[a]ct or
process of administering” including every act of “manag-
                  Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)             5

                      Opinion of the Court

ing” or “conduct[ing]” any “office,” or “performing the
executive duties of ” any “institution, business, or the like.”
Webster’s 34. But the whole phrase—the due administra-
tion of the Tax Code—is best viewed, like the due admin-
istration of justice, as referring to only some of those acts
or to some separable parts of an institution or business.
Cf. Aguilar, supra, at 600–601 (concluding false state-
ments made to an investigating agent, rather than a
grand jury, do not support a conviction for obstruction of
justice).
   Here statutory context confirms that the text refers to
specific, targeted acts of administration. The Omnibus
Clause appears in the middle of a statutory sentence that
refers specifically to efforts to “intimidate or impede any
officer or employee of the United States acting in an official
capacity.” </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">26</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §7212(a) (emphasis added). The
first part of the sentence also refers to “force or threats of
force,” which the statute elsewhere defines as “threats of
bodily harm to the officer or employee of the United States
or to a member of his family.” Ibid. (emphasis added).
The following subsection refers to the “forcibl[e] rescu[e]”
of “any property after it shall have been seized under” the
Internal Revenue Code.          §7212(b) (emphasis added).
Subsections (a) and (b) thus refer to corrupt or forceful
actions taken against individual identifiable persons or
property. And, in that context the Omnibus Clause logi-
cally serves as a “catchall” in respect to the obstructive
conduct the subsection sets forth, not as a “catchall” for
every violation that interferes with what the Government
describes as the “continuous, ubiquitous, and universally
known” administration of the Internal Revenue Code.
Brief in Opposition 9.
   Those who find legislative history helpful can find con-
firmation of the more limited scope of the Omnibus Clause
in the House and Senate Reports written when Congress
first enacted the Omnibus Clause. See H. R. Rep. No.
6              MARINELLO v. UNITED STATES

                     Opinion of the Court

1337, 83d Cong., 2d Sess. (1954); S. Rep. No. 1622, 83d
Cong., 2d Sess. (1954). According to the House Report,
§7212 “provides for the punishment of threats or threaten-
ing acts against agents of the Internal Revenue Service, or
any other officer or employee of the United States, or
members of the families of such persons, on account of the
performance by such agents or officers or employees of
their official duties” and “will also punish the corrupt
solicitation of an internal revenue employee.” H. R. Rep.
No. 1337, at A426 (emphasis added). The Senate Report
also refers to the section as aimed at targeting officers and
employees. It says that §7212 “covers all cases where the
officer is intimidated or injured; that is, where corruptly,
by force or threat of force, directly or by communication,
an attempt is made to impede the administration of the
internal-revenue laws.” S. Rep. No. 1622, at 147 (empha-
sis added). We have found nothing in the statute’s history
suggesting that Congress intended the Omnibus Clause as
a catchall applicable to the entire Code including the
routine processing of tax returns, receipt of tax payments,
and issuance of tax refunds.
   Viewing the Omnibus Clause in the broader statutory
context of the full Internal Revenue Code also counsels
against adopting the Government’s broad reading. That is
because the Code creates numerous misdemeanors, rang-
ing from willful failure to furnish a required statement to
employees, §7204, to failure to keep required records,
§7203, to misrepresenting the number of exemptions to
which an employee is entitled on IRS Form W–4, §7205, to
failure to pay any tax owed, however small the amount,
§7203. To interpret the Omnibus Clause as applying to all
Code administration would potentially transform many, if
not all, of these misdemeanor provisions into felonies,
making the specific provisions redundant, or perhaps the
subject matter of plea bargaining. Some overlap in crimi-
nal provisions is, of course, inevitable. See, e.g., Sansone

conviction for tax evasion despite overlap with other pro-
visions). Indeed, as the dissent notes, post, at 8 (opinion of
THOMAS, J.), Marinello’s preferred reading of §7212 poten-
tially overlaps with another provision of federal law that
criminalizes the obstruction of the “due and proper admin-
istration of the law under which any pending proceeding is
being had before any department or agency of the United
States,” </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">18</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §1505. But we have not found any
case from this Court interpreting a statutory provision
that would create overlap and redundancy to the degree
that would result from the Government’s broad reading of
§7212—particularly when it would “ ‘render superfluous
other provisions in the same enactment.’ ” Freytag v.

sion could apply to a person who pays a babysitter $41 per
week in cash without withholding taxes, see 26 CFR
§31.3102–1(a)(2017); IRS, Publication 926, pp. 5–6 (2018),
leaves a large cash tip in a restaurant, fails to keep dona-
tion receipts from every charity to which he or she con-
tributes, or fails to provide every record to an accountant.
Such an individual may sometimes believe that, in doing
so, he is running the risk of having violated an IRS rule,
but we sincerely doubt he would believe he is facing a
potential felony prosecution for tax obstruction. Had
Congress intended that outcome, it would have spoken
with more clarity than it did in §7212(a).
8              MARINELLO v. UNITED STATES

                      Opinion of the Court

  The Government argues that the need to show the
defendant’s obstructive conduct was done “corruptly” will
cure any overbreadth problem. But we do not see how.
The Government asserts that “corruptly” means acting
with “the specific intent to obtain an unlawful advantage”
for the defendant or another. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 37;
accord, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">839</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.</span> <span class=""page"">3d</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, at 218. Yet, practically speaking, we
struggle to imagine a scenario where a taxpayer would
“willfully” violate the Tax Code (the mens rea requirement
of various tax crimes, including misdemeanors, see, e.g.,
</pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">26</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §§7203, 7204, 7207) without intending someone
to obtain an unlawful advantage. See Cheek v. United
States, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""112517""><a href=""/opinion/112517/cheek-v-united-states/""><span class=""volume"">498</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">192</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 201 (1991) (“Willfulness . . . requires
the Government to prove that the law imposed a duty on
the defendant, that the defendant knew of this duty, and
that he voluntarily and intentionally violated that duty”)
A taxpayer may know with a fair degree of certainty that
her babysitter will not declare a cash payment as in-
come—and, if so, a jury could readily find that the taxpayer
acted to obtain an unlawful benefit for another. For the
same reason, we find unconvincing the dissent’s argument
that the distinction between “willfully” and “corruptly”—at
least as defined by the Government—reflects any mean-
ingful difference in culpability. See post, at 6–7.
  Neither can we rely upon prosecutorial discretion to
narrow the statute’s scope. True, the Government used
the Omnibus Clause only sparingly during the first few
decades after its enactment. But it used the clause more
often after the early 1990’s. Brief for Petitioner 9. And,
at oral argument the Government told us that, where
more punitive and less punitive criminal provisions both
apply to a defendant’s conduct, the Government will
charge a violation of the more punitive provision as long
as it can readily prove that violation at trial. Tr. of Oral
Arg. 46–47, 55–57; see Office of the Attorney General,
Department Charging and Sentencing Policy (May 10,

file/965896/download (as last visited Mar. 16, 2018).
   Regardless, to rely upon prosecutorial discretion to
narrow the otherwise wide-ranging scope of a criminal
statute’s highly abstract general statutory language places
great power in the hands of the prosecutor. Doing so risks
allowing “policemen, prosecutors, and juries to pursue
their personal predilections,” Smith v. Goguen, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""108988""><a href=""/opinion/108988/smith-v-goguen/""><span class=""volume"">415</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span>
<span class=""page"">566</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 575 (1974), which could result in the nonuniform
execution of that power across time and geographic loca-
tion. And insofar as the public fears arbitrary prosecution,
it risks undermining necessary confidence in the criminal
justice system. That is one reason why we have said that
we “cannot construe a criminal statute on the assumption
that the Government will ‘use it responsibly.’ ” McDonnell

   In sum, we follow the approach we have taken in similar
cases in interpreting §7212(a)’s Omnibus Clause. To be
sure, the language and history of the provision at issue
here differ somewhat from that of other obstruction provi-
sions we have considered in the past. See Aguilar, supra
(interpreting a statute prohibiting the obstruction of “the
due administration of justice”); Arthur Andersen, supra
(interpreting a statute prohibiting the destruction of an
object with intent to impair its integrity or availability for
use in an official proceeding); Yates, supra (interpreting a
statute prohibiting the destruction, concealment, or cover-
ing up of any “record, document, or tangible object with
the intent to” obstruct the “investigation or proper admin-
istration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any

department or agency of the United States”). The Gov-
ernment and the dissent urge us to ignore these prece-
dents because of those differences. The dissent points out,
for example, that the predecessor to the obstruction stat-
ute we interpreted in Aguilar, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">18</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §1503, prohibited
influencing, intimidating, or impeding “any witness or
officer in any court of the United States” or endeavoring
“to obstruct or imped[e] the due administration of justice
therein.” Pettibone v. United States, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""93551""><a href=""/opinion/93551/pettibone-v-united-states/""><span class=""volume"">148</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">197</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 202
(1893) (citing Rev. Stat. §5399; emphasis added); see post,
at 9. But Congress subsequently deleted the word “there-
in,” leaving only a broadly worded prohibition against
obstruction of “the due administration of justice.” Act of
June 25, 1948, §1503, 62 Stat. 769–770. Congress then
used that same amended formulation when it enacted
§7212, prohibiting the “obstruction of the due administra-
tion” of the Tax Code. Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 68A
Stat. 855. Given this similarity, it is helpful to consider
how we have interpreted §1503 and other obstruction
statutes in considering §7212. The language of some and
the underlying principles of all these cases are similar.
We consequently find these precedents—though not con-
trolling—highly instructive for use as a guide toward a
proper resolution of the issue now before us. See Smith v.
City of Jackson, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""142883""><a href=""/opinion/142883/smith-v-city-of-jackson/""><span class=""volume"">544</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">228</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 233 (2005).
   We conclude that, to secure a conviction under the
Omnibus Clause, the Government must show (among
other things) that there is a “nexus” between the defend-
ant’s conduct and a particular administrative proceeding,
such as an investigation, an audit, or other targeted ad-
ministrative action. That nexus requires a “relationship
in time, causation, or logic with the [administrative] pro-
ceeding.” Aguilar, 515 U. S., at 599 (citing Wood, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">6</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.</span> <span class=""page"">3d</span></span><pre class=""inline"">,
at 696). By “particular administrative proceeding” we do
not mean every act carried out by IRS employees in the
course of their “continuous, ubiquitous, and universally
                  Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)           11

                      Opinion of the Court

known” administration of the Tax Code. Brief in Opposi-
tion 9. While we need not here exhaustively itemize the
types of administrative conduct that fall within the scope
of the statute, that conduct does not include routine, day-
to-day work carried out in the ordinary course by the IRS,
such as the review of tax returns. The Government con-
tends the processing of tax returns is part of the admin-
istration of the Internal Revenue Code and any corrupt
effort to interfere with that task can therefore serve as the
basis of an obstruction conviction. But the same could
have been said of the defendant’s effort to mislead the
investigating agent in Aguilar. The agent’s investigation
was, at least in some broad sense, a part of the admin-
istration of justice. But we nevertheless held the defend-
ant’s conduct did not support an obstruction charge. 515
U. S., at 600. In light of our decision in Aguilar, we find it
appropriate to construe §7212’s Omnibus Clause more
narrowly than the Government proposes. Just because a
taxpayer knows that the IRS will review her tax return
every year does not transform every violation of the Tax
Code into an obstruction charge.
   In addition to satisfying this nexus requirement, the
Government must show that the proceeding was pending
at the time the defendant engaged in the obstructive
conduct or, at the least, was then reasonably foreseeable
by the defendant. See Arthur Andersen, 544 U. S., at 703,
707–708 (requiring the Government to prove a proceeding
was foreseeable in order to convict a defendant for per-
suading others to shred documents to prevent their “use in
an official proceeding”). It is not enough for the Govern-
ment to claim that the defendant knew the IRS may catch
on to his unlawful scheme eventually. To use a maritime
analogy, the proceeding must at least be in the offing.
   For these reasons, the Second Circuit’s judgment is
reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.
                                             It is so ordered.

           APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT

                       [March, 21 2018]


  JUSTICE THOMAS, with whom JUSTICE ALITO joins,
dissenting.
  The Omnibus Clause of </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">26</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §7212(a) of the In-
ternal Revenue Code (Tax Code) makes it a felony to
“corruptly . . . endeavo[r] to obstruct or imped[e] the due
administration of this title.” “[T]his title” refers to Title
26, which contains the entire Tax Code and authorizes the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to calculate, assess, and
collect taxes. I would hold that the Omnibus Clause does
what it says: forbid corrupt efforts to impede the IRS from
performing any of these activities. The Court, however,
reads “this title” to mean “a particular [IRS] proceeding.”
Ante, at 10. And that proceeding must be either “pending”
or “in the offing.” Ante, at 11. The Court may well prefer
a statute written that way, but that is not what Congress
enacted. I respectfully dissent.
                            I
  Petitioner Carlo J. Marinello, II, owned and managed a
company that provided courier services. Marinello, how-
ever, kept almost no records of the company’s earnings or
expenditures. He shredded or discarded most business
records. He paid his employees in cash and did not give
them tax documents. And he took tens of thousands of
dollars from the company each year to pay his personal
2              MARINELLO v. UNITED STATES

                    THOMAS, J., dissenting

expenses.
   Unbeknownst to Marinello, the IRS began investigating
him in 2004. The IRS learned that he had not filed a tax
return—corporate or individual—since at least 1992. But
the investigation came to a standstill because the IRS did
not have enough information about Marinello’s earnings.
This was not surprising given his diligent efforts to avoid
creating a paper trail. After the investigation ended,
Marinello consulted a lawyer and an accountant, both of
whom advised him that he needed to file tax returns and
keep business records. Despite these warnings, Marinello
did neither for another four years.
   In 2009, the IRS decided to investigate Marinello again.
In an interview with an IRS agent, Marinello initially
claimed he was exempt from filing tax returns because he
made less than $1,000 per year. Upon further question-
ing, however, Marinello changed his story. He admitted
that he earned more than $1,000 per year, but said he
“ ‘never got around’ ” to paying taxes. </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">839</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.3d</span> <span class=""page"">209</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 212
(CA2 2016). He also admitted that he shredded docu-
ments, did not keep track of the company’s income or
expenses, and used the company’s income for personal
bills. His only excuse was that he “took the easy way out.”
Ibid. After just a few hours of deliberation, a jury con-
victed Marinello of corruptly endeavoring to obstruct or
impede the due administration of the Tax Code, §7212(a).
                             II
    Section 7212(a)’s Omnibus Clause prohibits “corruptly
. . . obstruct[ing] or imped[ing], or endeavor[ing] to ob-
struct or impede, the due administration of this title.” I
agree with the Court’s interpretations of “obstruct or
impede” and “due administration,” which together refer to
conduct that hinders the IRS’ performance of its official
duties. See ante, at 4–5. I also agree that the object of
these words—the thing a person is prohibited from ob-
                  Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)            3

                     THOMAS, J., dissenting

structing the due administration of—is “this title,” i.e.,
Title 26, which contains the entire Tax Code. See ante, at
4. But I part ways when the Court concludes that the
whole phrase “due administration of the Tax Code” means
“only some of ” the Tax Code—specifically “particular [IRS]
proceeding[s], such as an investigation, an audit, or other
targeted administrative action.” Ante, at 5, 10. That
limitation has no basis in the text. In my view, the plain
text of the Omnibus Clause prohibits obstructing the due
administration of the Tax Code in its entirety, not just
particular IRS proceedings.
                                A
   The words “this title” cannot be read to mean “only some
of this title.” As this Court recently reiterated, phrases
such as “this title” most naturally refer to the cited provi-
sion “as a whole.” Rubin v. Islamic Republic of Iran, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">583</span>
<span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 8). Congress used “this
title” throughout Title 26 to refer to the Tax Code in its
entirety. See, e.g., §7201 (“[a]ny person who willfully
attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any tax im-
posed by this title”); §7203 (“[a]ny person required under
this title to pay any estimated tax or tax, or required by
this title . . . to make a return, keep any records, or supply
any information, who willfully fails to [do so]”). And,
“[w]hen Congress wanted to refer only to a particular
subsection or paragraph, it said so.” NLRB v. SW General,
Inc., </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">580</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 9); see, e.g.,
§7204 (criminalizing willfully failing to furnish a state-
ment “required under section 6051”); §7207 (criminalizing
willfully furnishing fraudulent or materially false infor-
mation “required pursuant to section 6047(b), section
6104(d), or subsection (i) or (j) of section 527”); §7210
(criminalizing neglecting to appear or produce documents
“required under section 6420(e)(2), 6421(g)(2), 6427( j)(2),
7602, 7603, and 7604(b)”). Thus, “this title” must refer to
4               MARINELLO v. UNITED STATES

                     THOMAS, J., dissenting

the Tax Code as a whole.
   The phrase “due administration of this title” likewise
refers to the due administration of the entire Tax Code.
As this Court has recognized, “administration” of the Tax
Code includes four basic steps: information gathering,
assessment, levy, and collection. See Direct Marketing
Assn. v. Brohl, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">575</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">___, ___–___ (2015) (slip op., at 6–
7). The first “phase of tax administration procedure” is
“information gathering.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6); see,
e.g., §§6001–6096. “This step includes private reporting of
information used to determine tax liability, including
reports by third parties who do not owe the tax.” Id., at
___ (slip op., at 6) (citation omitted). The “next step in the
process” is “assessment,” which includes “the process by
which [a taxpayer’s liability] is calculated” and the “official
recording of a taxpayer’s liability.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at
6); see, e.g., §§6201–6241. After information gathering
and assessment come “levy” and “collection.” See id., at
___ (slip op., at 7); see, e.g., §§6301–6344. Levy refers to “a
specific mode of collection under which the Secretary of
the Treasury distrains and seizes a recalcitrant taxpayer’s
property.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 7). Collection refers to
“the act of obtaining payment of taxes due.” Ibid.
   Subtitle F of the Tax Code—titled “Procedure and Ad-
ministration”—contains directives related to each of these
steps. It requires taxpayers to keep certain records and
file certain returns, §6001; specifies that taxpayers with
qualifying incomes must file returns, §6012; and author-
izes the Secretary of the Treasury to create returns for
taxpayers who fail to file returns or who file fraudulent
ones, §6020. It requires the Secretary to make inquiries,
determinations, and assessments of tax liabilities. §6201.
And it authorizes the Secretary to collect and levy taxes.
§§6301, 6331. Subtitle F also gives the Secretary the
power to commence proceedings to recover unpaid taxes or
fees, §§7401–7410, and to conduct investigations into the
                  Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)            5

                     THOMAS, J., dissenting

accuracy of particular returns, §§7601–7613.
  Accordingly, the phrase “due administration of this title”
refers to the entire process of taxation, from gathering
information to assessing tax liabilities to collecting and
levying taxes. It is not limited to only a few specific provi-
sions within the Tax Code.
                              B
   The Court rejects this straightforward reading, describ-
ing the “literal language” of the Omnibus Clause as “neu-
tral.” Ante, at 4. It concludes that the statute prohibits
only acts related to a pending or imminent proceeding.
Ante, at 10–11. There is no textual or contextual support
for this limitation.
   The text of the Omnibus Clause is not “neutral”; it omits
the limitation that the Court reads into it. The Omnibus
Clause nowhere suggests that “only some of ” the processes
in the Tax Code are covered, ante, at 5, or that the line
between covered and uncovered processes is drawn at
some vague notion of “proceeding.” The Omnibus Clause
does not use the word “proceeding” at all, but instead
refers to the entire Tax Code, which covers much more
than that. This Court cannot “lightly assume that Con-
gress has omitted from its adopted text requirements that
it nonetheless intends to apply.” Jama v. Immigration
and Customs Enforcement, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""137740""><a href=""/opinion/137740/jama-v-immigration-and-customs-enforcement/""><span class=""volume"">543</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">335</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 341 (2005).
   Having failed to find its proposed limit in the text, the
Court turns to context. However, its two contextual ar-
guments fare no better.
   First, the Court contends that the Omnibus Clause must
be limited to pending or imminent proceedings because
the other clauses of §7212 are limited to actions “taken
against individual identifiable persons or property.” Ante,
at 5. But specific clauses in a statute typically do not limit
the scope of a general omnibus clause. See Ali v. Federal
Bureau of Prisons, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""145834""><a href=""/opinion/145834/ali-v-federal-bureau-of-prisons/""><span class=""volume"">552</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">214</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 225 (2008) (explaining
6              MARINELLO v. UNITED STATES

                     THOMAS, J., dissenting

that the ejusdem generis canon does not apply to a “dis-
junctive” phrase in a statute “with one specific and one
general category”). Nor do the other clauses in §7212
contain the pending-or-imminent-proceeding requirement
that the Court reads into the Omnibus Clause. See
§7212(a) (prohibiting efforts to “intimidate or impede any
officer or employee of the United States acting in an offi-
cial capacity”); §7212(b) (prohibiting “forcibly rescu[ing] or
caus[ing] to be rescued any property after it shall have
been seized under this title”). They thus provide no sup-
port for the Court’s atextual limitation.
  Second, the Court asserts that its reading prevents the
Omnibus Clause from overlapping with certain misde-
meanors in the Tax Code. Ante, at 6–7 (discussing §§7203,
7204, 7205). But there is no redundancy problem because
these provisions have different mens rea requirements.
The Omnibus Clause requires that an act be done “cor-
ruptly,” but the misdemeanor provisions require that an
act be done “willfully.” The difference between these mens
rea requirements is significant. While “willfully” requires
proof only “that the law imposed a duty on the defendant,
that the defendant knew of this duty, and that he volun-
tarily and intentionally violated that duty,” Cheek v. United
States, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""112517""><a href=""/opinion/112517/cheek-v-united-states/""><span class=""volume"">498</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">192</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 201 (1991), “corruptly” requires
proof that the defendant “act[ed] with an intent to procure
an unlawful benefit either for [himself] or for some other
person,” United States v. Floyd, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">740</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.3d</span> <span class=""page"">22</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 31 (CA1
2014) (collecting cases); see also Black’s Law Dictionary
414 (rev. 4th ed. 1951) (“corruptly” “generally imports a
wrongful design to acquire some pecuniary or other ad-
vantage”). In other words, “corruptly” requires proof that
the defendant not only knew he was obtaining an “unlaw-
ful benefit” but that his “objective” or “purpose” was to
obtain that unlawful benefit. See 21 Am. Jur. 2d, Crimi-
nal Law §114 (2016) (explaining that specific intent re-
quires both knowledge and purpose).

                     THOMAS, J., dissenting

   The Court dismisses the significance of the different
mens rea requirements, see ante, at 8, but this difference
is important under basic principles of criminal law. The
law recognizes that the same conduct, when committed
with a higher mens rea, is more culpable and thus more
deserving of punishment. See Schad v. Arizona, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""112637""><a href=""/opinion/112637/schad-v-arizona/""><span class=""volume"">501</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span>
<span class=""page"">624</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 643 (1991) (plurality opinion). For that reason, dif-
ferent mens rea requirements often differentiate culpabil-
ity for the same conduct. See, e.g., 40 C. J. S., Homicide
§80 (2014) (explaining that the distinction between first-
and second-degree murder is based on the defendant’s
state of mind); §103 (same for voluntary and involuntary
manslaughter). Unless the Court means to cast doubt on
this well-established principle, it should not casually
dismiss the different mens rea requirements in the Omni-
bus Clause and the various misdemeanors in the Tax
Code.
   Even if the Omnibus Clause did overlap with these
other misdemeanors, that would prove little. For better or
worse, redundancy abounds in both the criminal law and
the Tax Code. This Court has repeatedly declined to
depart from the plain meaning of the text simply because
the same conduct would be criminalized under two or
more provisions. See, e.g., Loughrin v. United States, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">573</span>
<span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">___, ___, n. 4 (2014) (slip op., at 7, n. 4) (“No doubt,

misdemeanor offenses in the Tax Code—such as failing to
obey a summons, §7210—apply to conduct that takes place
during a proceeding and, thus, would still violate the
Omnibus Clause under the Court’s interpretation. The
Court’s interpretation also makes the Omnibus Clause
largely redundant with </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">18</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §1505, which already
prohibits “corruptly . . . endeavor[ing] to influence, ob-
struct, or impede the due and proper administration of the
law under which any pending proceeding is being had
before any department or agency of the United States.”
Avoiding redundancy is thus not a reason to favor the
Court’s interpretation. Cf. Marx v. General Revenue Corp.,

  The Court contends that its narrow reading of “due
administration of this title” is supported by three decisions
interpreting other obstruction statutes, though it admits
that the “language and history” of the Omnibus Clause
“differ somewhat” from those other obstruction provisions.

   * The Court also relies on legislative history to support its interpreta-
tion. See ante, at 5–6. Even assuming legislative history could impose
a requirement that does not appear in the text, the Court cites nothing
in the legislative history that limits the Omnibus Clause to proceed-
ings—or even uses the word “proceeding.” In fact, the legislative
history does not say anything at all about the Omnibus Clause. As
Marinello concedes, the vague snippets of legislative history that the
Court cites are discussing a different portion of </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">26</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §7212(a),
involving threats against IRS officers and their family members. See

(plurality opinion)).     “[D]iffer somewhat” is putting
it lightly. The differences between the Omnibus Clause
and those other obstruction statutes demonstrate why
the former does not contain the Court’s proceeding
requirement.
   Aguilar interpreted </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">18</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §1503. The omnibus
clause of §1503 forbids corruptly endeavoring to obstruct
“the due administration of justice.” The Court concluded
that this language requires the prosecution to prove a
“nexus” between the defendant’s obstructive act and “judi-
cial proceedings.” 515 U. S., at 599–600. But this nexus
requirement was based on the specific history of §1503.
The predecessor to that statute prohibited obstructing “the
due administration of justice” “in any court of the United
States.” Pettibone v. United States, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""93551""><a href=""/opinion/93551/pettibone-v-united-states/""><span class=""volume"">148</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">197</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 202
(1893) (citing Rev. Stat. §5399). Based on this statutory
history, the Court assumed that §1503 continued to refer
to the administration of justice in a court. Aguilar, supra,
at 599. None of that history is present here.
   Arthur Anderson is even further afield. There the Court
interpreted </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">18</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §1512(b)(2)(A), which prohibits
“knowingly . . . corruptly persuad[ing] another person . . .
with intent to . . . cause or induce [that] person to . . .
withhold testimony, or withhold a record, document, or
other object, from an official proceeding.” Relying on
Aguilar, the Court concluded that §1512(b)(2)(A) required
the Government to show a “nexus” with “[a] particular
proceeding.” 544 U. S., at 707–708. But this nexus re-
quirement came from the statutory text, which expressly
included “an official proceeding.”      If anything, then,
§1512(b)(2)(A) cuts against the Court’s interpretation of
the Omnibus Clause because it shows that Congress
knows how to impose a “proceeding” requirement when it
wants to do so. See Kucana v. Holder, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""1744""><a href=""/opinion/1744/kucana-v-holder/""><span class=""volume"">558</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">233</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 248
(2010); Jama, 543 U. S., at 341.
   Yates underscores this point. There the Court inter-
10             MARINELLO v. UNITED STATES

                     THOMAS, J., dissenting

preted </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">18</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §1519, which prohibits obstructing “the
investigation or proper administration of any matter
within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the
United States.” The four Justices in the plurality recog-
nized that this language made §1519 broader than other
obstruction statutes: Section 1519 “covers conduct intended
to impede any federal investigation or proceeding, includ-
ing one not even on the verge of commencement.” 574
U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 18). The plurality contrasted the
term “official proceeding” with the phrase “investigation or
proper administration of any matter within the jurisdic-
tion of any department or agency,” noting that the latter is
broader. Id., at ___–___ (slip op., at 12–13). The same is
true for the broad language of the Omnibus Clause.
   In sum, these cases demonstrate that, when text and
history justify it, this Court interprets obstruction statutes
to include a proceeding requirement. But we have never
inserted such a requirement into an obstruction statute
without textual or historical support. Today the Court
does precisely that.
                               D
  All else having failed, the Court invokes lenity-sounding
concerns to justify reading its proceeding requirement into
the Omnibus Clause. See ante, at 4, 7. But the rule of
lenity applies only if after applying ordinary tools of statu-
tory interpretation, “there remains a grievous ambiguity
or uncertainty in the statute such that the Court must
simply guess as to what Congress intended.” Barber v.
Thomas, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""147954""><a href=""/opinion/147954/barber-v-thomas/""><span class=""volume"">560</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">474</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 488 (2010) (citation and internal
quotation marks omitted). The Court identifies no such
grievous ambiguity in the Omnibus Clause, and breadth is
not the same thing as ambiguity. The Omnibus Clause is
both “very broad” and “very clear.” Yates, supra, at ___
(KAGAN, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 15). Lenity does not
apply.

                     THOMAS, J., dissenting

   If the Court is concerned that the Omnibus Clause does
not give defendants “fair warning” of what it prohibits,
ante, at 7, I am hard pressed to see how today’s decision
makes things better. The Court outlines its atextual
proceeding requirement in only the vaguest of terms.
Under its interpretation, the prosecution must prove a
“nexus” between the defendant’s conduct and some “par-
ticular administrative proceeding.”             Ante, at 10.
“[P]articular administrative proceeding” is defined nega-
tively as “not . . . every act carried out by IRS employees in
the course of their ‘continuous, ubiquitous, and universally
known’ administration of the Tax Code.” Ante, at 10–11.
Further, the Government must prove that the proceeding
was “reasonably foreseeable” to the defendant. Ante, at
11. “Reasonably foreseeable” is again defined negatively
as “not . . . that the defendant knew the IRS may catch
onto his unlawful scheme eventually.” Ibid. It is hard to
see how the Court’s statute is less vague than the one
Congress drafted, which simply instructed individuals not
to corruptly obstruct or impede the IRS’ administration of
the Tax Code.
                               E
    To be sure, §7212(a) is a sweeping obstruction statute.
Congress may well have concluded that a broad statute
was warranted because “our tax structure is based on a
system of self-reporting” and “the Government depends
upon the good faith and integrity of each potential tax-
payer to disclose honestly all information relevant to tax
liability.” United States v. Bisceglia, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""109190""><a href=""/opinion/109190/united-states-v-bisceglia/""><span class=""volume"">420</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">141</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 145
(1975). Whether or not we agree with Congress’ judgment,
we must leave the ultimate “[r]esolution of the pros and
cons of whether a statute should sweep broadly or narrowly
. . . for Congress.” United States v. Rodgers, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""111163""><a href=""/opinion/111163/united-states-v-rodgers/""><span class=""volume"">466</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">475</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">,

enacted.” Lewis v. Chicago, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""146985""><a href=""/opinion/146985/lewis-v-chicago/""><span class=""volume"">560</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">205</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 217 (2010).
  The Court frets that the Omnibus Clause might apply to
“a person who pays a babysitter $41 per week in cash
without withholding taxes,” “leaves a large cash tip in a
restaurant,” “fails to keep donation receipts from every
charity,” or “fails to provide every record to an account-
ant.” Ante, at 7. Whether the Omnibus Clause would
cover these hypotheticals—and whether the Government
would waste its resources identifying and prosecuting
them—is debatable. But what should not be debatable is
that the statute covers Marinello, who systematically
shredded documents and hid evidence about his company’s
earnings to avoid paying taxes even after warnings from
his lawyer and accountant. It is not hard to find similar
cases prosecuted under the Omnibus Clause. See, e.g.,
United States v. Sorenson, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">801</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.3d</span> <span class=""page"">1217</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 1221–1222

fendant created elaborate scheme to avoid paying payroll
taxes).
  The Court, in its effort to exclude hypotheticals, has
constructed an opening in the Omnibus Clause large
enough that even the worst offenders can escape liability.
In doing so, it failed to heed what this Court recognized in
a similar case: “[T]he authority vested in tax collectors
may be abused, as all power is subject to abuse. However,
the solution is not to restrict that authority so as to un-
dermine the efficacy of the federal tax system.” Bisceglia,
supra, at 146.
                        *     *     *
  Regardless of whether this Court thinks the Omnibus
Clause should contain a proceeding requirement, it does not
have one. Because the text prohibits all efforts to obstruct the
due administration of the Tax Code, I respectfully dissent.

                 MARINELLO v. UNITED STATES

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT

   No. 16–1144. Argued December 6, 2017—Decided March 21, 2018
Between 2004 and 2009, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) intermit-
  tently investigated petitioner Marinello’s tax activities. In 2012, the
  Government indicted Marinello for violating, among other criminal
  tax statutes, a provision in 26 U. S. C. §7212(a) known as the Omni-
  bus Clause, which forbids “corruptly or by force or threats of force . . .
  obstruct[ing] or imped[ing], or endeavor[ing] to obstruct or impede,
  the due administration of [the Internal Revenue Code].” The judge
  instructed the jury that, to convict Marinello of an Omnibus Clause
  violation, it must find that he “corruptly” engaged in at least one of
  eight specified activities, but the jury was not told that it needed to
  find that Marinello knew he was under investigation and intended
  corruptly to interfere with that investigation. Marinello was convict-
  ed. The Second Circuit affirmed, rejecting his claim that an Omnibus
  Clause violation requires the Government to show the defendant
  tried to interfere with a pending IRS proceeding, such as a particular
  investigation.
Held: To convict a defendant under the Omnibus Clause, the Govern-
  ment must prove the defendant was aware of a pending tax-related
  proceeding, such as a particular investigation or audit, or could rea-
  sonably foresee that such a proceeding would commence. Pp. 3–11.
     (a) In United States v. Aguilar, 515 U. S. 593, this Court interpret-
  ed a similarly worded criminal statute—which made it a felony “cor-
  ruptly or by threats or force . . . [to] influenc[e], obstruc[t], or
  imped[e], or endeavo[r] to influence, obstruct, or impede, the due ad-
  ministration of justice,” 18 U. S. C. §1503(a). There, the Court re-
  quired the Government to show there was a “nexus” between the de-
  fendant’s obstructive conduct and a particular judicial proceeding.
  The Court said that the defendant’s “act must have a relationship in
2                   MARINELLO v. UNITED STATES

                                  Syllabus

    time, causation, or logic with the judicial proceedings.” 515 U. S., at
    599. In reaching this conclusion, the Court emphasized that it has
    “traditionally exercised restraint in assessing the reach of a federal
    criminal statute, both out of deference to the prerogatives of Congress
    and out of concern that ‘a fair warning should be given to the world
    in language that the common world will understand, of what the law
    intends to do if a certain line is passed.’ ” Id., at 600. That reasoning
    applies here with similar strength. The verbs “obstruct” and “im-
    pede” require an object. The taxpayer must hinder a particular per-
    son or thing. The object in §7212(a) is the “due administration of [the
    Tax Code].” That phrase is best viewed, like the “due administration
    of justice” in Aguilar, as referring to discrete targeted administrative
    acts rather than every conceivable task involved in the Tax Code’s
    administration. Statutory context confirms this reading. The Omni-
    bus Clause appears in the middle of a sentence that refers to efforts
    to “intimidate or impede any officer or employee of the United States
    acting in an official capacity.” §7212(a). The first part of the sen-
    tence also refers to “force or threats of force,” which the statute else-
    where defines as “threats of bodily harm to the officer or employee of
    the United States or to a member of his family.” Ibid. And §7212(b)
    refers to the “forcibl[e] rescu[e]” of “any property after it shall have
    been seized under” the Internal Revenue Code. Subsections (a) and
    (b) thus refer to corrupt or forceful actions taken against individual
    identifiable persons or property. In context, the Omnibus Clause log-
    ically serves as a “catchall” for the obstructive conduct the subsection
    sets forth, not for every violation that interferes with routine admin-
    istrative procedures such as the processing of tax returns, receipt of
    tax payments, or issuance of tax refunds. The statute’s legislative
    history does not suggest otherwise. The broader context of the full
    Internal Revenue Code also counsels against a broad reading. Inter-
    preting the Omnibus Clause to apply to all Code administration could
    transform the Code’s numerous misdemeanor provisions into felonies,
    making them redundant or perhaps the subject matter of plea bar-
    gaining. It could also result in a similar lack of fair warning and re-
    lated kinds of unfairness that led this Court to “exercise” interpretive
    “restraint” in Aguilar. See 515 U. S., at 600. The Government claims
    that the “corrupt state of mind” requirement will cure any over-
    breadth problem, but it is difficult to imagine a scenario when that
    requirement will make a practical difference in the context of federal
    tax prosecutions. And to rely on prosecutorial discretion to narrow
    the otherwise wide-ranging scope of a criminal statute’s general lan-
    guage places too much power in the prosecutor’s hands. Pp. 3–9.
       (b) Following the same approach taken in similar cases, the Gov-
    ernment here must show that there is a “nexus” between the defend-

  ant’s conduct and a particular administrative proceeding, such as an
  investigation, an audit, or other targeted administrative action. See
  Aguilar, supra, at 599. The term “particular administrative proceed-
  ing” does not mean every act carried out by IRS employees in the
  course of their administration of the Tax Code. Just because a tax-
  payer knows that the IRS will review her tax return annually does
  not transform every Tax Code violation into an obstruction charge.
  In addition to satisfying the nexus requirement, the Government
  must show that the proceeding was pending at the time the defend-
  ant engaged in the obstructive conduct or, at the least, was then rea-
  sonably foreseeable by the defendant. See Arthur Andersen LLP v.
  United States, 544 U. S. 696, 703, 707–708. Pp. 9–11.

 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

           APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT

                                [March 21, 2018]


  JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.
  A clause in §7212(a) of the Internal Revenue Code
makes it a felony “corruptly or by force” to “endeavo[r] to
obstruct or imped[e] the due administration of this title.”
26 U. S. C. §7212(a). The question here concerns the
breadth of that statutory phrase. Does it cover virtually
all governmental efforts to collect taxes? Or does it have a
narrower scope? In our view, “due administration of [the
Tax Code]” does not cover routine administrative proce-
dures that are near-universally applied to all taxpayers,
such as the ordinary processing of income tax returns.
Rather, the clause as a whole refers to specific interference
with targeted governmental tax-related proceedings, such
as a particular investigation or audit.
                               I
  The Internal Revenue Code provision at issue, §7212(a),
has two substantive clauses. The first clause, which we
shall call the “Officer Clause,” forbids
    “corruptly or by force or threats of force (including any
    threatening letter or communication) endeavor[ing] to
    intimidate or impede any officer or employee of the
2              MARINELLO v. UNITED STATES

                      Opinion of the Court

    United States acting in an official capacity under [the
    Internal Revenue Code].” Ibid. (emphasis added).
The second clause, which we shall call the “Omnibus
Clause,” forbids
    “corruptly or by force or threats of force (including any
    threatening letter or communication) obstruct[ing] or
    imped[ing], or endeavor[ing] to obstruct or impede, the
    due administration of [the Internal Revenue Code].”
    Ibid. (emphasis added).
As we said at the outset, we here consider the scope of the
Omnibus Clause. (We have placed the full text of §7212 in
the Appendix, infra.)
    Between 2004 and 2009, the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) opened, then closed, then reopened an investigation
into the tax activities of Carlo Marinello, the petitioner
here. In 2012 the Government indicted Marinello, charg-
ing him with violations of several criminal tax statutes
including the Omnibus Clause. In respect to the Omnibus
Clause the Government claimed that Marinello had en-
gaged in at least one of eight different specified activities,
including “failing to maintain corporate books and rec-
ords,” “failing to provide” his tax accountant “with com-
plete and accurate” tax “information,” “destroying . . .
business records,” “hiding income,” and “paying employees
. . . with cash.” 839 F. 3d 209, 213 (CA2 2016).
    Before the jury retired to consider the charges, the judge
instructed it that, to convict Marinello of violating the
Omnibus Clause, it must find unanimously that he en-
gaged in at least one of the eight practices just mentioned,
that the jurors need not agree on which one, and that he
did so “corruptly,” meaning “with the intent to secure an
unlawful advantage or benefit, either for [himself] or for
another.” App. in No. 15–2224 (CA2), p. 432. The judge,
however, did not instruct the jury that it must find that
Marinello knew he was under investigation and intended
                 Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)            3

                     Opinion of the Court

corruptly to interfere with that investigation. The jury
subsequently convicted Marinello on all counts.
   Marinello appealed to the Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit. He argued, among other things, that a
violation of the Omnibus Clause requires the Government
to show that the defendant had tried to interfere with a
“pending IRS proceeding,” such as a particular investiga-
tion. Brief for Appellant in No. 15–2224, pp. 23–25. The
appeals court disagreed. It held that a defendant need not
possess “ ‘an awareness of a particular [IRS] action or
investigation.’ ” 839 F. 3d, at 221 (quoting United States v.
Wood, 384 Fed. Appx. 698, 704 (CA2 2010); alteration in
original). The full Court of Appeals rejected Marinello’s
petition for rehearing, two judges dissenting. 855 F. 3d
455 (CA2 2017).
   Marinello then petitioned for certiorari, asking us to
decide whether the Omnibus Clause requires the Govern-
ment to prove the defendant was aware of “a pending IRS
action or proceeding, such as an investigation or audit,”
when he “engaged in the purportedly obstructive conduct.”
Pet. for Cert. i. In light of a division of opinion among the
Circuits on this point, we granted the petition. Compare
United States v. Kassouf, 144 F. 3d 952 (CA6 1998) (re-
quiring showing of a pending proceeding), with 839 F. 3d,
at 221 (disagreeing with Kassouf ).
                             II
  In United States v. Aguilar, 515 U. S. 593 (1995), we
interpreted a similarly worded criminal statute. That
statute made it a felony “corruptly or by threats or force,
or by any threatening letter or communication, [to] influ-
enc[e], obstruc[t], or imped[e], or endeavo[r] to influence,
obstruct, or impede, the due administration of justice.” 18
U. S. C. §1503(a). The statute concerned not (as here) “the
due administration of ” the Internal Revenue Code but
rather “the due administration of justice.” (We have
4              MARINELLO v. UNITED STATES

                     Opinion of the Court

placed the full text of §1503 in the Appendix, infra.)
   In interpreting that statute we pointed to earlier cases
in which courts had held that the Government must prove
“an intent to influence judicial or grand jury proceedings.”
Aguilar, supra, at 599 (citing United States v. Brown, 688
F. 2d 596, 598 (CA9 1982)). We noted that some courts
had imposed a “ ‘nexus’ requirement”: that the defendant’s
“act must have a relationship in time, causation, or logic
with the judicial proceedings.” Aguilar, supra, at 599
(citing United States v. Wood, 6 F. 3d 692, 696 (CA10
1993), and United States v. Walasek, 527 F. 2d 676,
679, and n. 12 (CA3 1975)). And we adopted the same
requirement.
   We set forth two important reasons for doing so. We
wrote that we “have traditionally exercised restraint in
assessing the reach of a federal criminal statute, both out
of deference to the prerogatives of Congress and out of
concern that ‘a fair warning should be given to the world
in language that the common world will understand, of
what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed.’ ”
Aguilar, supra, at 600 (quoting McBoyle v. United States,
283 U. S. 25, 27 (1931); citation omitted). Both reasons
apply here with similar strength.
   As to Congress’ intent, the literal language of the stat-
ute is neutral. The statutory words “obstruct or impede”
are broad. They can refer to anything that “block[s],”
“make[s] difficult,” or “hinder[s].” Black’s Law Dictionary
1246 (10th ed. 2014) (obstruct); Webster’s New Interna-
tional Dictionary (Webster’s) 1248 (2d ed. 1954) (impede);
id., at 1682 (obstruct); accord, 5 Oxford English Dictionary
80 (1933) (impede); 7 id., at 36 (obstruct). But the verbs
“obstruct” and “impede” suggest an object—the taxpayer
must hinder a particular person or thing. Here, the object
is the “due administration of this title.” The word “admin-
istration” can be read literally to refer to every “[a]ct or
process of administering” including every act of “manag-
                  Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)             5

                      Opinion of the Court

ing” or “conduct[ing]” any “office,” or “performing the
executive duties of ” any “institution, business, or the like.”
Webster’s 34. But the whole phrase—the due administra-
tion of the Tax Code—is best viewed, like the due admin-
istration of justice, as referring to only some of those acts
or to some separable parts of an institution or business.
Cf. Aguilar, supra, at 600–601 (concluding false state-
ments made to an investigating agent, rather than a
grand jury, do not support a conviction for obstruction of
justice).
   Here statutory context confirms that the text refers to
specific, targeted acts of administration. The Omnibus
Clause appears in the middle of a statutory sentence that
refers specifically to efforts to “intimidate or impede any
officer or employee of the United States acting in an official
capacity.” 26 U. S. C. §7212(a) (emphasis added). The
first part of the sentence also refers to “force or threats of
force,” which the statute elsewhere defines as “threats of
bodily harm to the officer or employee of the United States
or to a member of his family.” Ibid. (emphasis added).
The following subsection refers to the “forcibl[e] rescu[e]”
of “any property after it shall have been seized under” the
Internal Revenue Code.          §7212(b) (emphasis added).
Subsections (a) and (b) thus refer to corrupt or forceful
actions taken against individual identifiable persons or
property. And, in that context the Omnibus Clause logi-
cally serves as a “catchall” in respect to the obstructive
conduct the subsection sets forth, not as a “catchall” for
every violation that interferes with what the Government
describes as the “continuous, ubiquitous, and universally
known” administration of the Internal Revenue Code.
Brief in Opposition 9.
   Those who find legislative history helpful can find con-
firmation of the more limited scope of the Omnibus Clause
in the House and Senate Reports written when Congress
first enacted the Omnibus Clause. See H. R. Rep. No.
6              MARINELLO v. UNITED STATES

                     Opinion of the Court

1337, 83d Cong., 2d Sess. (1954); S. Rep. No. 1622, 83d
Cong., 2d Sess. (1954). According to the House Report,
§7212 “provides for the punishment of threats or threaten-
ing acts against agents of the Internal Revenue Service, or
any other officer or employee of the United States, or
members of the families of such persons, on account of the
performance by such agents or officers or employees of
their official duties” and “will also punish the corrupt
solicitation of an internal revenue employee.” H. R. Rep.
No. 1337, at A426 (emphasis added). The Senate Report
also refers to the section as aimed at targeting officers and
employees. It says that §7212 “covers all cases where the
officer is intimidated or injured; that is, where corruptly,
by force or threat of force, directly or by communication,
an attempt is made to impede the administration of the
internal-revenue laws.” S. Rep. No. 1622, at 147 (empha-
sis added). We have found nothing in the statute’s history
suggesting that Congress intended the Omnibus Clause as
a catchall applicable to the entire Code including the
routine processing of tax returns, receipt of tax payments,
and issuance of tax refunds.
   Viewing the Omnibus Clause in the broader statutory
context of the full Internal Revenue Code also counsels
against adopting the Government’s broad reading. That is
because the Code creates numerous misdemeanors, rang-
ing from willful failure to furnish a required statement to
employees, §7204, to failure to keep required records,
§7203, to misrepresenting the number of exemptions to
which an employee is entitled on IRS Form W–4, §7205, to
failure to pay any tax owed, however small the amount,
§7203. To interpret the Omnibus Clause as applying to all
Code administration would potentially transform many, if
not all, of these misdemeanor provisions into felonies,
making the specific provisions redundant, or perhaps the
subject matter of plea bargaining. Some overlap in crimi-
nal provisions is, of course, inevitable. See, e.g., Sansone
                  Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)            7

                      Opinion of the Court

v. United States, 380 U. S. 343, 349 (1965) (affirming
conviction for tax evasion despite overlap with other pro-
visions). Indeed, as the dissent notes, post, at 8 (opinion of
THOMAS, J.), Marinello’s preferred reading of §7212 poten-
tially overlaps with another provision of federal law that
criminalizes the obstruction of the “due and proper admin-
istration of the law under which any pending proceeding is
being had before any department or agency of the United
States,” 18 U. S. C. §1505. But we have not found any
case from this Court interpreting a statutory provision
that would create overlap and redundancy to the degree
that would result from the Government’s broad reading of
§7212—particularly when it would “ ‘render superfluous
other provisions in the same enactment.’ ” Freytag v.
Commissioner, 501 U. S. 868, 877 (1991) (quoting Pennsyl-
vania Dept. of Public Welfare v. Davenport, 495 U. S. 552,
562 (1990); see also Yates v. United States, 574 U. S. ___,
___ (2015) (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 13).
   A broad interpretation would also risk the lack of fair
warning and related kinds of unfairness that led this
Court in Aguilar to “exercise” interpretive “restraint.” See
515 U. S., at 600; see also Yates, supra, at ___–___ (slip
op., at 18–19); Arthur Andersen LLP v. United States, 544
U. S. 696, 703–704 (2005). Interpreted broadly, the provi-
sion could apply to a person who pays a babysitter $41 per
week in cash without withholding taxes, see 26 CFR
§31.3102–1(a)(2017); IRS, Publication 926, pp. 5–6 (2018),
leaves a large cash tip in a restaurant, fails to keep dona-
tion receipts from every charity to which he or she con-
tributes, or fails to provide every record to an accountant.
Such an individual may sometimes believe that, in doing
so, he is running the risk of having violated an IRS rule,
but we sincerely doubt he would believe he is facing a
potential felony prosecution for tax obstruction. Had
Congress intended that outcome, it would have spoken
with more clarity than it did in §7212(a).
8              MARINELLO v. UNITED STATES

                      Opinion of the Court

  The Government argues that the need to show the
defendant’s obstructive conduct was done “corruptly” will
cure any overbreadth problem. But we do not see how.
The Government asserts that “corruptly” means acting
with “the specific intent to obtain an unlawful advantage”
for the defendant or another. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 37;
accord, 839 F. 3d, at 218. Yet, practically speaking, we
struggle to imagine a scenario where a taxpayer would
“willfully” violate the Tax Code (the mens rea requirement
of various tax crimes, including misdemeanors, see, e.g.,
26 U. S. C. §§7203, 7204, 7207) without intending someone
to obtain an unlawful advantage. See Cheek v. United
States, 498 U. S. 192, 201 (1991) (“Willfulness . . . requires
the Government to prove that the law imposed a duty on
the defendant, that the defendant knew of this duty, and
that he voluntarily and intentionally violated that duty”)
A taxpayer may know with a fair degree of certainty that
her babysitter will not declare a cash payment as in-
come—and, if so, a jury could readily find that the taxpayer
acted to obtain an unlawful benefit for another. For the
same reason, we find unconvincing the dissent’s argument
that the distinction between “willfully” and “corruptly”—at
least as defined by the Government—reflects any mean-
ingful difference in culpability. See post, at 6–7.
  Neither can we rely upon prosecutorial discretion to
narrow the statute’s scope. True, the Government used
the Omnibus Clause only sparingly during the first few
decades after its enactment. But it used the clause more
often after the early 1990’s. Brief for Petitioner 9. And,
at oral argument the Government told us that, where
more punitive and less punitive criminal provisions both
apply to a defendant’s conduct, the Government will
charge a violation of the more punitive provision as long
as it can readily prove that violation at trial. Tr. of Oral
Arg. 46–47, 55–57; see Office of the Attorney General,
Department Charging and Sentencing Policy (May 10,

2017), online at http://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/
file/965896/download (as last visited Mar. 16, 2018).
   Regardless, to rely upon prosecutorial discretion to
narrow the otherwise wide-ranging scope of a criminal
statute’s highly abstract general statutory language places
great power in the hands of the prosecutor. Doing so risks
allowing “policemen, prosecutors, and juries to pursue
their personal predilections,” Smith v. Goguen, 415 U. S.
566, 575 (1974), which could result in the nonuniform
execution of that power across time and geographic loca-
tion. And insofar as the public fears arbitrary prosecution,
it risks undermining necessary confidence in the criminal
justice system. That is one reason why we have said that
we “cannot construe a criminal statute on the assumption
that the Government will ‘use it responsibly.’ ” McDonnell
v. United States, 579 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 23)
(quoting United States v. Stevens, 559 U. S. 460, 480
(2010)). And it is why “[w]e have traditionally exercised
restraint in assessing the reach of a federal criminal stat-
ute.” Aguilar, supra, at 600.
                             III
   In sum, we follow the approach we have taken in similar
cases in interpreting §7212(a)’s Omnibus Clause. To be
sure, the language and history of the provision at issue
here differ somewhat from that of other obstruction provi-
sions we have considered in the past. See Aguilar, supra
(interpreting a statute prohibiting the obstruction of “the
due administration of justice”); Arthur Andersen, supra
(interpreting a statute prohibiting the destruction of an
object with intent to impair its integrity or availability for
use in an official proceeding); Yates, supra (interpreting a
statute prohibiting the destruction, concealment, or cover-
ing up of any “record, document, or tangible object with
the intent to” obstruct the “investigation or proper admin-
istration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any
10             MARINELLO v. UNITED STATES

                     Opinion of the Court

department or agency of the United States”). The Gov-
ernment and the dissent urge us to ignore these prece-
dents because of those differences. The dissent points out,
for example, that the predecessor to the obstruction stat-
ute we interpreted in Aguilar, 18 U. S. C. §1503, prohibited
influencing, intimidating, or impeding “any witness or
officer in any court of the United States” or endeavoring
“to obstruct or imped[e] the due administration of justice
therein.” Pettibone v. United States, 148 U. S. 197, 202
(1893) (citing Rev. Stat. §5399; emphasis added); see post,
at 9. But Congress subsequently deleted the word “there-
in,” leaving only a broadly worded prohibition against
obstruction of “the due administration of justice.” Act of
June 25, 1948, §1503, 62 Stat. 769–770. Congress then
used that same amended formulation when it enacted
§7212, prohibiting the “obstruction of the due administra-
tion” of the Tax Code. Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 68A
Stat. 855. Given this similarity, it is helpful to consider
how we have interpreted §1503 and other obstruction
statutes in considering §7212. The language of some and
the underlying principles of all these cases are similar.
We consequently find these precedents—though not con-
trolling—highly instructive for use as a guide toward a
proper resolution of the issue now before us. See Smith v.
City of Jackson, 544 U. S. 228, 233 (2005).
   We conclude that, to secure a conviction under the
Omnibus Clause, the Government must show (among
other things) that there is a “nexus” between the defend-
ant’s conduct and a particular administrative proceeding,
such as an investigation, an audit, or other targeted ad-
ministrative action. That nexus requires a “relationship
in time, causation, or logic with the [administrative] pro-
ceeding.” Aguilar, 515 U. S., at 599 (citing Wood, 6 F. 3d,
at 696). By “particular administrative proceeding” we do
not mean every act carried out by IRS employees in the
course of their “continuous, ubiquitous, and universally
                  Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)           11

                      Opinion of the Court

known” administration of the Tax Code. Brief in Opposi-
tion 9. While we need not here exhaustively itemize the
types of administrative conduct that fall within the scope
of the statute, that conduct does not include routine, day-
to-day work carried out in the ordinary course by the IRS,
such as the review of tax returns. The Government con-
tends the processing of tax returns is part of the admin-
istration of the Internal Revenue Code and any corrupt
effort to interfere with that task can therefore serve as the
basis of an obstruction conviction. But the same could
have been said of the defendant’s effort to mislead the
investigating agent in Aguilar. The agent’s investigation
was, at least in some broad sense, a part of the admin-
istration of justice. But we nevertheless held the defend-
ant’s conduct did not support an obstruction charge. 515
U. S., at 600. In light of our decision in Aguilar, we find it
appropriate to construe §7212’s Omnibus Clause more
narrowly than the Government proposes. Just because a
taxpayer knows that the IRS will review her tax return
every year does not transform every violation of the Tax
Code into an obstruction charge.
   In addition to satisfying this nexus requirement, the
Government must show that the proceeding was pending
at the time the defendant engaged in the obstructive
conduct or, at the least, was then reasonably foreseeable
by the defendant. See Arthur Andersen, 544 U. S., at 703,
707–708 (requiring the Government to prove a proceeding
was foreseeable in order to convict a defendant for per-
suading others to shred documents to prevent their “use in
an official proceeding”). It is not enough for the Govern-
ment to claim that the defendant knew the IRS may catch
on to his unlawful scheme eventually. To use a maritime
analogy, the proceeding must at least be in the offing.
   For these reasons, the Second Circuit’s judgment is
reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.
                                             It is so ordered.

                       [March, 21 2018]


  JUSTICE THOMAS, with whom JUSTICE ALITO joins,
dissenting.
  The Omnibus Clause of 26 U. S. C. §7212(a) of the In-
ternal Revenue Code (Tax Code) makes it a felony to
“corruptly . . . endeavo[r] to obstruct or imped[e] the due
administration of this title.” “[T]his title” refers to Title
26, which contains the entire Tax Code and authorizes the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to calculate, assess, and
collect taxes. I would hold that the Omnibus Clause does
what it says: forbid corrupt efforts to impede the IRS from
performing any of these activities. The Court, however,
reads “this title” to mean “a particular [IRS] proceeding.”
Ante, at 10. And that proceeding must be either “pending”
or “in the offing.” Ante, at 11. The Court may well prefer
a statute written that way, but that is not what Congress
enacted. I respectfully dissent.
                            I
  Petitioner Carlo J. Marinello, II, owned and managed a
company that provided courier services. Marinello, how-
ever, kept almost no records of the company’s earnings or
expenditures. He shredded or discarded most business
records. He paid his employees in cash and did not give
them tax documents. And he took tens of thousands of
dollars from the company each year to pay his personal
2              MARINELLO v. UNITED STATES

                    THOMAS, J., dissenting

expenses.
   Unbeknownst to Marinello, the IRS began investigating
him in 2004. The IRS learned that he had not filed a tax
return—corporate or individual—since at least 1992. But
the investigation came to a standstill because the IRS did
not have enough information about Marinello’s earnings.
This was not surprising given his diligent efforts to avoid
creating a paper trail. After the investigation ended,
Marinello consulted a lawyer and an accountant, both of
whom advised him that he needed to file tax returns and
keep business records. Despite these warnings, Marinello
did neither for another four years.
   In 2009, the IRS decided to investigate Marinello again.
In an interview with an IRS agent, Marinello initially
claimed he was exempt from filing tax returns because he
made less than $1,000 per year. Upon further question-
ing, however, Marinello changed his story. He admitted
that he earned more than $1,000 per year, but said he
“ ‘never got around’ ” to paying taxes. 839 F. 3d 209, 212
(CA2 2016). He also admitted that he shredded docu-
ments, did not keep track of the company’s income or
expenses, and used the company’s income for personal
bills. His only excuse was that he “took the easy way out.”
Ibid. After just a few hours of deliberation, a jury con-
victed Marinello of corruptly endeavoring to obstruct or
impede the due administration of the Tax Code, §7212(a).
                             II
    Section 7212(a)’s Omnibus Clause prohibits “corruptly
. . . obstruct[ing] or imped[ing], or endeavor[ing] to ob-
struct or impede, the due administration of this title.” I
agree with the Court’s interpretations of “obstruct or
impede” and “due administration,” which together refer to
conduct that hinders the IRS’ performance of its official
duties. See ante, at 4–5. I also agree that the object of
these words—the thing a person is prohibited from ob-
                  Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)            3

                     THOMAS, J., dissenting

structing the due administration of—is “this title,” i.e.,
Title 26, which contains the entire Tax Code. See ante, at
4. But I part ways when the Court concludes that the
whole phrase “due administration of the Tax Code” means
“only some of ” the Tax Code—specifically “particular [IRS]
proceeding[s], such as an investigation, an audit, or other
targeted administrative action.” Ante, at 5, 10. That
limitation has no basis in the text. In my view, the plain
text of the Omnibus Clause prohibits obstructing the due
administration of the Tax Code in its entirety, not just
particular IRS proceedings.
                                A
   The words “this title” cannot be read to mean “only some
of this title.” As this Court recently reiterated, phrases
such as “this title” most naturally refer to the cited provi-
sion “as a whole.” Rubin v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 583
U. S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 8). Congress used “this
title” throughout Title 26 to refer to the Tax Code in its
entirety. See, e.g., §7201 (“[a]ny person who willfully
attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any tax im-
posed by this title”); §7203 (“[a]ny person required under
this title to pay any estimated tax or tax, or required by
this title . . . to make a return, keep any records, or supply
any information, who willfully fails to [do so]”). And,
“[w]hen Congress wanted to refer only to a particular
subsection or paragraph, it said so.” NLRB v. SW General,
Inc., 580 U. S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 9); see, e.g.,
§7204 (criminalizing willfully failing to furnish a state-
ment “required under section 6051”); §7207 (criminalizing
willfully furnishing fraudulent or materially false infor-
mation “required pursuant to section 6047(b), section
6104(d), or subsection (i) or (j) of section 527”); §7210
(criminalizing neglecting to appear or produce documents
“required under section 6420(e)(2), 6421(g)(2), 6427( j)(2),
7602, 7603, and 7604(b)”). Thus, “this title” must refer to
4               MARINELLO v. UNITED STATES

                     THOMAS, J., dissenting

the Tax Code as a whole.
   The phrase “due administration of this title” likewise
refers to the due administration of the entire Tax Code.
As this Court has recognized, “administration” of the Tax
Code includes four basic steps: information gathering,
assessment, levy, and collection. See Direct Marketing
Assn. v. Brohl, 575 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2015) (slip op., at 6–
7). The first “phase of tax administration procedure” is
“information gathering.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6); see,
e.g., §§6001–6096. “This step includes private reporting of
information used to determine tax liability, including
reports by third parties who do not owe the tax.” Id., at
___ (slip op., at 6) (citation omitted). The “next step in the
process” is “assessment,” which includes “the process by
which [a taxpayer’s liability] is calculated” and the “official
recording of a taxpayer’s liability.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at
6); see, e.g., §§6201–6241. After information gathering
and assessment come “levy” and “collection.” See id., at
___ (slip op., at 7); see, e.g., §§6301–6344. Levy refers to “a
specific mode of collection under which the Secretary of
the Treasury distrains and seizes a recalcitrant taxpayer’s
property.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 7). Collection refers to
“the act of obtaining payment of taxes due.” Ibid.
   Subtitle F of the Tax Code—titled “Procedure and Ad-
ministration”—contains directives related to each of these
steps. It requires taxpayers to keep certain records and
file certain returns, §6001; specifies that taxpayers with
qualifying incomes must file returns, §6012; and author-
izes the Secretary of the Treasury to create returns for
taxpayers who fail to file returns or who file fraudulent
ones, §6020. It requires the Secretary to make inquiries,
determinations, and assessments of tax liabilities. §6201.
And it authorizes the Secretary to collect and levy taxes.
§§6301, 6331. Subtitle F also gives the Secretary the
power to commence proceedings to recover unpaid taxes or
fees, §§7401–7410, and to conduct investigations into the
                  Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)            5

                     THOMAS, J., dissenting

accuracy of particular returns, §§7601–7613.
  Accordingly, the phrase “due administration of this title”
refers to the entire process of taxation, from gathering
information to assessing tax liabilities to collecting and
levying taxes. It is not limited to only a few specific provi-
sions within the Tax Code.
                              B
   The Court rejects this straightforward reading, describ-
ing the “literal language” of the Omnibus Clause as “neu-
tral.” Ante, at 4. It concludes that the statute prohibits
only acts related to a pending or imminent proceeding.
Ante, at 10–11. There is no textual or contextual support
for this limitation.
   The text of the Omnibus Clause is not “neutral”; it omits
the limitation that the Court reads into it. The Omnibus
Clause nowhere suggests that “only some of ” the processes
in the Tax Code are covered, ante, at 5, or that the line
between covered and uncovered processes is drawn at
some vague notion of “proceeding.” The Omnibus Clause
does not use the word “proceeding” at all, but instead
refers to the entire Tax Code, which covers much more
than that. This Court cannot “lightly assume that Con-
gress has omitted from its adopted text requirements that
it nonetheless intends to apply.” Jama v. Immigration
and Customs Enforcement, 543 U. S. 335, 341 (2005).
   Having failed to find its proposed limit in the text, the
Court turns to context. However, its two contextual ar-
guments fare no better.
   First, the Court contends that the Omnibus Clause must
be limited to pending or imminent proceedings because
the other clauses of §7212 are limited to actions “taken
against individual identifiable persons or property.” Ante,
at 5. But specific clauses in a statute typically do not limit
the scope of a general omnibus clause. See Ali v. Federal
Bureau of Prisons, 552 U. S. 214, 225 (2008) (explaining
6              MARINELLO v. UNITED STATES

                     THOMAS, J., dissenting

that the ejusdem generis canon does not apply to a “dis-
junctive” phrase in a statute “with one specific and one
general category”). Nor do the other clauses in §7212
contain the pending-or-imminent-proceeding requirement
that the Court reads into the Omnibus Clause. See
§7212(a) (prohibiting efforts to “intimidate or impede any
officer or employee of the United States acting in an offi-
cial capacity”); §7212(b) (prohibiting “forcibly rescu[ing] or
caus[ing] to be rescued any property after it shall have
been seized under this title”). They thus provide no sup-
port for the Court’s atextual limitation.
  Second, the Court asserts that its reading prevents the
Omnibus Clause from overlapping with certain misde-
meanors in the Tax Code. Ante, at 6–7 (discussing §§7203,
7204, 7205). But there is no redundancy problem because
these provisions have different mens rea requirements.
The Omnibus Clause requires that an act be done “cor-
ruptly,” but the misdemeanor provisions require that an
act be done “willfully.” The difference between these mens
rea requirements is significant. While “willfully” requires
proof only “that the law imposed a duty on the defendant,
that the defendant knew of this duty, and that he volun-
tarily and intentionally violated that duty,” Cheek v. United
States, 498 U. S. 192, 201 (1991), “corruptly” requires
proof that the defendant “act[ed] with an intent to procure
an unlawful benefit either for [himself] or for some other
person,” United States v. Floyd, 740 F. 3d 22, 31 (CA1
2014) (collecting cases); see also Black’s Law Dictionary
414 (rev. 4th ed. 1951) (“corruptly” “generally imports a
wrongful design to acquire some pecuniary or other ad-
vantage”). In other words, “corruptly” requires proof that
the defendant not only knew he was obtaining an “unlaw-
ful benefit” but that his “objective” or “purpose” was to
obtain that unlawful benefit. See 21 Am. Jur. 2d, Crimi-
nal Law §114 (2016) (explaining that specific intent re-
quires both knowledge and purpose).

                     THOMAS, J., dissenting

   The Court dismisses the significance of the different
mens rea requirements, see ante, at 8, but this difference
is important under basic principles of criminal law. The
law recognizes that the same conduct, when committed
with a higher mens rea, is more culpable and thus more
deserving of punishment. See Schad v. Arizona, 501 U. S.
624, 643 (1991) (plurality opinion). For that reason, dif-
ferent mens rea requirements often differentiate culpabil-
ity for the same conduct. See, e.g., 40 C. J. S., Homicide
§80 (2014) (explaining that the distinction between first-
and second-degree murder is based on the defendant’s
state of mind); §103 (same for voluntary and involuntary
manslaughter). Unless the Court means to cast doubt on
this well-established principle, it should not casually
dismiss the different mens rea requirements in the Omni-
bus Clause and the various misdemeanors in the Tax
Code.
   Even if the Omnibus Clause did overlap with these
other misdemeanors, that would prove little. For better or
worse, redundancy abounds in both the criminal law and
the Tax Code. This Court has repeatedly declined to
depart from the plain meaning of the text simply because
the same conduct would be criminalized under two or
more provisions. See, e.g., Loughrin v. United States, 573
U. S. ___, ___, n. 4 (2014) (slip op., at 7, n. 4) (“No doubt,
the overlap between the two clauses is substantial on our
reading, but that is not uncommon in criminal statutes”);
Hubbard v. United States, 514 U. S. 695, 714, n. 14 (1995)
(“Congress may, and often does, enact separate criminal
statutes that may, in practice, cover some of the same
conduct”); Sansone v. United States, 380 U. S. 343, 352
(1965) (allowing the Government to proceed on a felony
tax evasion charge even though that charge “ ‘covered
precisely the same ground’ ” as two misdemeanors in the
Tax Code). In fact, the Court’s interpretation of the Om-
nibus Clause does not eliminate the redundancy. Certain
8                  MARINELLO v. UNITED STATES

                          THOMAS, J., dissenting

misdemeanor offenses in the Tax Code—such as failing to
obey a summons, §7210—apply to conduct that takes place
during a proceeding and, thus, would still violate the
Omnibus Clause under the Court’s interpretation. The
Court’s interpretation also makes the Omnibus Clause
largely redundant with 18 U. S. C. §1505, which already
prohibits “corruptly . . . endeavor[ing] to influence, ob-
struct, or impede the due and proper administration of the
law under which any pending proceeding is being had
before any department or agency of the United States.”
Avoiding redundancy is thus not a reason to favor the
Court’s interpretation. Cf. Marx v. General Revenue Corp.,
568 U. S. 371, 385 (2013) (“[T]he canon against surplusage
‘assists only where a competing interpretation gives effect
to every clause and word of a statute’ ”).*
                               C
  The Court contends that its narrow reading of “due
administration of this title” is supported by three decisions
interpreting other obstruction statutes, though it admits
that the “language and history” of the Omnibus Clause
“differ somewhat” from those other obstruction provisions.
Ante, at 9 (citing United States v. Aguilar, 515 U. S. 593
(1995); Arthur Andersen LLP v. United States, 544 U. S.
696 (2005); Yates v. United States, 574 U. S. ___ (2015)
——————
   * The Court also relies on legislative history to support its interpreta-
tion. See ante, at 5–6. Even assuming legislative history could impose
a requirement that does not appear in the text, the Court cites nothing
in the legislative history that limits the Omnibus Clause to proceed-
ings—or even uses the word “proceeding.” In fact, the legislative
history does not say anything at all about the Omnibus Clause. As
Marinello concedes, the vague snippets of legislative history that the
Court cites are discussing a different portion of 26 U. S. C. §7212(a),
involving threats against IRS officers and their family members. See
Reply Brief 11 (“The conceded focus of §7212(a)’s legislative history was
the officers clause” and it was “relative[ly] silen[t] regarding [the
Omnibus Clause]”).

(plurality opinion)).     “[D]iffer somewhat” is putting
it lightly. The differences between the Omnibus Clause
and those other obstruction statutes demonstrate why
the former does not contain the Court’s proceeding
requirement.
   Aguilar interpreted 18 U. S. C. §1503. The omnibus
clause of §1503 forbids corruptly endeavoring to obstruct
“the due administration of justice.” The Court concluded
that this language requires the prosecution to prove a
“nexus” between the defendant’s obstructive act and “judi-
cial proceedings.” 515 U. S., at 599–600. But this nexus
requirement was based on the specific history of §1503.
The predecessor to that statute prohibited obstructing “the
due administration of justice” “in any court of the United
States.” Pettibone v. United States, 148 U. S. 197, 202
(1893) (citing Rev. Stat. §5399). Based on this statutory
history, the Court assumed that §1503 continued to refer
to the administration of justice in a court. Aguilar, supra,
at 599. None of that history is present here.
   Arthur Anderson is even further afield. There the Court
interpreted 18 U. S. C. §1512(b)(2)(A), which prohibits
“knowingly . . . corruptly persuad[ing] another person . . .
with intent to . . . cause or induce [that] person to . . .
withhold testimony, or withhold a record, document, or
other object, from an official proceeding.” Relying on
Aguilar, the Court concluded that §1512(b)(2)(A) required
the Government to show a “nexus” with “[a] particular
proceeding.” 544 U. S., at 707–708. But this nexus re-
quirement came from the statutory text, which expressly
included “an official proceeding.”      If anything, then,
§1512(b)(2)(A) cuts against the Court’s interpretation of
the Omnibus Clause because it shows that Congress
knows how to impose a “proceeding” requirement when it
wants to do so. See Kucana v. Holder, 558 U. S. 233, 248
(2010); Jama, 543 U. S., at 341.
   Yates underscores this point. There the Court inter-
10             MARINELLO v. UNITED STATES

                     THOMAS, J., dissenting

preted 18 U. S. C. §1519, which prohibits obstructing “the
investigation or proper administration of any matter
within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the
United States.” The four Justices in the plurality recog-
nized that this language made §1519 broader than other
obstruction statutes: Section 1519 “covers conduct intended
to impede any federal investigation or proceeding, includ-
ing one not even on the verge of commencement.” 574
U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 18). The plurality contrasted the
term “official proceeding” with the phrase “investigation or
proper administration of any matter within the jurisdic-
tion of any department or agency,” noting that the latter is
broader. Id., at ___–___ (slip op., at 12–13). The same is
true for the broad language of the Omnibus Clause.
   In sum, these cases demonstrate that, when text and
history justify it, this Court interprets obstruction statutes
to include a proceeding requirement. But we have never
inserted such a requirement into an obstruction statute
without textual or historical support. Today the Court
does precisely that.
                               D
  All else having failed, the Court invokes lenity-sounding
concerns to justify reading its proceeding requirement into
the Omnibus Clause. See ante, at 4, 7. But the rule of
lenity applies only if after applying ordinary tools of statu-
tory interpretation, “there remains a grievous ambiguity
or uncertainty in the statute such that the Court must
simply guess as to what Congress intended.” Barber v.
Thomas, 560 U. S. 474, 488 (2010) (citation and internal
quotation marks omitted). The Court identifies no such
grievous ambiguity in the Omnibus Clause, and breadth is
not the same thing as ambiguity. The Omnibus Clause is
both “very broad” and “very clear.” Yates, supra, at ___
(KAGAN, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 15). Lenity does not
apply.

                     THOMAS, J., dissenting

   If the Court is concerned that the Omnibus Clause does
not give defendants “fair warning” of what it prohibits,
ante, at 7, I am hard pressed to see how today’s decision
makes things better. The Court outlines its atextual
proceeding requirement in only the vaguest of terms.
Under its interpretation, the prosecution must prove a
“nexus” between the defendant’s conduct and some “par-
ticular administrative proceeding.”             Ante, at 10.
“[P]articular administrative proceeding” is defined nega-
tively as “not . . . every act carried out by IRS employees in
the course of their ‘continuous, ubiquitous, and universally
known’ administration of the Tax Code.” Ante, at 10–11.
Further, the Government must prove that the proceeding
was “reasonably foreseeable” to the defendant. Ante, at
11. “Reasonably foreseeable” is again defined negatively
as “not . . . that the defendant knew the IRS may catch
onto his unlawful scheme eventually.” Ibid. It is hard to
see how the Court’s statute is less vague than the one
Congress drafted, which simply instructed individuals not
to corruptly obstruct or impede the IRS’ administration of
the Tax Code.
                               E
    To be sure, §7212(a) is a sweeping obstruction statute.
Congress may well have concluded that a broad statute
was warranted because “our tax structure is based on a
system of self-reporting” and “the Government depends
upon the good faith and integrity of each potential tax-
payer to disclose honestly all information relevant to tax
liability.” United States v. Bisceglia, 420 U. S. 141, 145
(1975). Whether or not we agree with Congress’ judgment,
we must leave the ultimate “[r]esolution of the pros and
cons of whether a statute should sweep broadly or narrowly
. . . for Congress.” United States v. Rodgers, 466 U. S. 475,
484 (1984). “[I]t is not our task to assess the consequences
of each approach and adopt the one that produces the least
12              MARINELLO v. UNITED STATES

                      THOMAS, J., dissenting

mischief. Our charge is to give effect to the law Congress
enacted.” Lewis v. Chicago, 560 U. S. 205, 217 (2010).
  The Court frets that the Omnibus Clause might apply to
“a person who pays a babysitter $41 per week in cash
without withholding taxes,” “leaves a large cash tip in a
restaurant,” “fails to keep donation receipts from every
charity,” or “fails to provide every record to an account-
ant.” Ante, at 7. Whether the Omnibus Clause would
cover these hypotheticals—and whether the Government
would waste its resources identifying and prosecuting
them—is debatable. But what should not be debatable is
that the statute covers Marinello, who systematically
shredded documents and hid evidence about his company’s
earnings to avoid paying taxes even after warnings from
his lawyer and accountant. It is not hard to find similar
cases prosecuted under the Omnibus Clause. See, e.g.,
United States v. Sorenson, 801 F. 3d 1217, 1221–1222
(CA10 2015) (defendant hid taxable income in elaborate
system of trusts); Floyd, 740 F. 3d, at 26–27, 31–32 (de-
fendant created elaborate scheme to avoid paying payroll
taxes).
  The Court, in its effort to exclude hypotheticals, has
constructed an opening in the Omnibus Clause large
enough that even the worst offenders can escape liability.
In doing so, it failed to heed what this Court recognized in
a similar case: “[T]he authority vested in tax collectors
may be abused, as all power is subject to abuse. However,
the solution is not to restrict that authority so as to un-
dermine the efficacy of the federal tax system.” Bisceglia,
supra, at 146.
                        *     *     *
  Regardless of whether this Court thinks the Omnibus
Clause should contain a proceeding requirement, it does not
have one. Because the text prohibits all efforts to obstruct the
due administration of the Tax Code, I respectfully dissent.

In the wake of the 1929 stock market crash, Congress enacted two laws,
  in successive years, to promote honest practices in the securities
  markets. The Securities Act of 1933 (1933 Act) creates private rights
  of action to aid the enforcement of obligations pertaining to securities
  offerings. The Act authorizes both federal and state courts to exer-
  cise jurisdiction over those private suits and, more unusually, bars
  the removal of such suits from state to federal court. The Securities
  Exchange Act of 1934 (1934 Act), which regulates not the original is-
  suance of securities but all their subsequent trading, is also enforcea-
  ble through private rights of action. But all suits brought under the
  1934 Act fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts.
     In 1995, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (Reform Act)
  amended both Acts, in order to stem perceived abuses of the class-
  action vehicle in securities litigation. The Reform Act included both
  substantive reforms, applicable in state and federal court alike, and
  procedural reforms, applicable only in federal court. Rather than
  face these new obstacles, plaintiffs began filing securities class ac-
  tions under state law.
     To prevent this end run around the Reform Act, Congress passed
  the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 (SLUSA),
  whose amendments to the 1933 Act are at issue in this case. As rele-
  vant here, those amendments include two operative provisions, two
  associated definitions, and two “conforming amendments.”
     First, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">15</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §77p(b) completely disallows (in both state and
  federal courts) “covered class actions” alleging dishonest practices “in
  connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.” Accord-
  ing to SLUSA’s definitions, the term “covered class action” means a

                              Syllabus


    class action in which “damages are sought on behalf of more than 50
    persons.” §77p(f)(2). And the term “covered security” refers to a se-
    curity listed on a national stock exchange. §77p(f)(3). Next, §77p(c)
    provides for the removal of certain class actions to federal court,
    where they are subject to dismissal. Finally, SLUSA’s “conforming
    amendments” add two new phrases to §77v(a), the 1933 Act’s juris-
    dictional provision. The first creates an exception to §77v(a)’s gen-
    eral removal bar through the language “[e]xcept as provided in sec-
    tion 77p(c).” The other—the key provision in this case—expresses a
    caveat to the general rule that state and federal courts have concur-
    rent jurisdiction over all claims to enforce the 1933 Act. With this
    conforming amendment, §77v(a) now provides that state and federal
    courts shall have concurrent jurisdiction, “except as provided in sec-
    tion 77p . . . with respect to covered class actions.” The Court refers
    to this provision as the “except clause.”
       Respondents, three pension funds and an individual (Investors),
    purchased shares of stock in petitioner Cyan, Inc., in an initial public
    offering. After the stock declined in value, the Investors brought a
    damages class action against Cyan in state court, alleging 1933 Act
    violations. They did not assert any claims based on state law. Cyan
    moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, arguing that
    SLUSA’s “except clause” stripped state courts of power to adjudicate
    1933 Act claims in “covered class actions.” The Investors maintained
    that SLUSA left intact state courts’ jurisdiction over all suits—
    including “covered class actions”—alleging only 1933 Act claims. The
    state courts agreed with the Investors and denied Cyan’s motion to
    dismiss. This Court granted certiorari to decide whether SLUSA de-
    prived state courts of jurisdiction over “covered class actions” assert-
    ing only 1933 Act claims. The Court also addresses a related ques-
    tion raised by the federal Government as amicus curiae and
    addressed by the parties in briefing and argument: whether SLUSA
    enabled defendants to remove 1933 Act class actions from state to
    federal court for adjudication.
Held:
    1. SLUSA did nothing to strip state courts of their longstanding ju-
 risdiction to adjudicate class actions brought under the 1933 Act.
 Pp. 7–18.
       (a) SLUSA’s text, read most straightforwardly, leaves this juris-
 diction intact. The background rule of §77v(a)—in place since the
 1933 Act’s passage—gives state courts concurrent jurisdiction over all
 suits “brought to enforce any liability or duty created by” that stat-
 ute. And the except clause—“except as provided in section 77p of this
 title with respect to covered class actions”—ensures that in any case
 in which §77v(a) and §77p conflict, §77p will control. The critical
                    Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)                      3

                               Syllabus

question for this case is therefore whether §77p limits state-court ju-
risdiction over class actions brought under the 1933 Act. It does not.
Section 77p bars certain securities class actions based on state law
but it says nothing, and so does nothing, to deprive state courts of ju-
risdiction over class actions based on federal law. That means
§77v(a)’s background rule—under which a state court may hear the
Investors’ 1933 Act suit—continues to govern.
   Cyan argues that the except clause’s reference to “covered class ac-
tions” points the reader to §77p(f)(2), which defines that term to
mean a suit seeking damages on behalf of more than fifty persons—
without mentioning anything about whether the suit is based on
state or federal law. But that view cannot be squared with the except
clause’s wording for two independent reasons. First, the except
clause points to “section 77p” as a whole—not to paragraph 77p(f)(2).
Had Congress intended to refer to §77p(f)(2)’s definition alone, it pre-
sumably would have done so. See NLRB v. SW General, Inc., </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">580</span>
<span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">___, ___. Second, a definition, like §77p(f)(2), does not “pro-
vide[]” an “except[ion],” but instead gives meaning to a term—and
Congress well knows the difference between those two functions. Not
one of the 30-plus provisions in the 1933 and 1934 Acts using the
phrase “except as provided in . . .” cross-references a definition.
   Structure and context also support the Court’s reading of the ex-
cept clause. Because Cyan treats the broad definition of “covered
class action” as altering §77v(a)’s jurisdictional grant, its construction
would prevent state courts from deciding any 1933 Act class suits
seeking damages for more than fifty plaintiffs, thus stripping state
courts of jurisdiction over suits about securities raising no particular
national interest. That result is out of line with SLUSA’s overall
scope. Moreover, it is highly unlikely that Congress upended the 65-
year practice of state courts’ adjudicating all manner of 1933 Act cas-
es (including class actions) by way of a mere conforming amendment.

CoBank ACB, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""118404""><a href=""/opinion/118404/director-of-revenue-of-mo-v-cobank-acb/""><span class=""volume"">531</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">316</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 324.
Pp. 8–12.
     (b) Cyan’s reliance on legislative purpose and history is unavail-
ing. Pp. 12–18.
       (1) Cyan insists that the only way for SLUSA to serve the Re-
form Act’s objectives was by divesting state courts of jurisdiction over
all sizable 1933 Act class actions. Specifically, it claims that its read-
ing is necessary to prevent plaintiffs from circumventing the Reform
Act’s procedural measures, which apply only in federal court, by
bringing 1933 Act class actions in state court.
   But Cyan ignores a different way in which SLUSA served the Re-
form Act’s objectives—which the Court’s view of the statute fully ef-
fects. The Reform Act included substantive sections protecting de-
4            CYAN, INC. v. BEAVER COUNTY EMPLOYEES

                              Syllabus


    fendants in suits brought under the federal securities laws. Plaintiffs
    circumvented those provisions by bringing their complaints of securi-
    ties misconduct under state law instead. Hence emerged SLUSA’s
    bar on state-law class actions (and its removal provision to ensure
    their dismissal)—which guaranteed that the Reform Act’s heightened
    substantive standards would govern all future securities class litiga-
    tion. SLUSA’s preamble states that the statute is designed “to limit
    the conduct of securities class actions under state law, and for other
    purposes,” 112 Stat. 3227, and this Court has underscored, over and
    over, SLUSA’s “purpose to preclude certain vexing state-law class ac-
    tions.” Kircher v. Putnam Funds Trust, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""145645""><a href=""/opinion/145645/kircher-v-putnam-funds-trust/""><span class=""volume"">547</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">633</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 645, n. 12.
    That object—which SLUSA’s text actually reflects—does not depend
    on stripping state courts of jurisdiction over 1933 Act class suits, as
    Cyan proposes. For wherever those suits go forward, the Reform
    Act’s substantive protections necessarily apply.
        SLUSA also went a good distance toward ensuring that federal
    courts would play the principal role in adjudicating securities class
    actions by means of its revisions to the 1934 Act. Because federal
    courts have exclusive jurisdiction over 1934 Act claims, forcing plain-
    tiffs to bring class actions under the 1934 statute instead of state law
    also forced them to file in federal court. Pp. 12–15.
            (2) Cyan finally argues that the except clause would serve no
    purpose at all unless it works as Cyan says. But Congress could have
    envisioned the except clause as the ultimate fail-safe device, designed
    to safeguard §77p’s class-action bar come whatever might. Congress
    has been known to legislate in that hyper-vigilant way, to “remov[e]
    any doubt” as to things not particularly doubtful in the first instance.
    Marx v. General Revenue Corp., </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">568</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">371</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 383–384. If ever it
    had reason to legislate in that fashion, it was in SLUSA—whose very
    impetus lay in the success of class action attorneys in “bypass[ing]
    . . . the Reform Act.” Kircher, 547 U. S., at 636. And regardless of
    any uncertainty surrounding Congress’s reasons for drafting the ex-
    cept clause, there is no sound basis for giving that clause a broader
    reading than its language can bear, especially in light of the dramatic
    change such an interpretation would work in the 1933 Act’s jurisdic-
    tional framework. Pp. 15–18.
        2. SLUSA does not permit defendants to remove class actions alleg-
    ing only 1933 Act claims from state to federal court. The Govern-
    ment argues that §77p(c) allows defendants to remove 1933 Act class
    actions to federal court as long as they allege the kinds of misconduct
    listed in §77p(b). But most naturally read, §77p(c) refutes, not sup-
    ports, the Government’s view. Section 77p(c) allows for removal of
    “[a]ny covered class action brought in any State court involving a
    covered security, as set forth in subsection (b).” The covered class ac-
                     Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)                      5

                                Syllabus

  tions “set forth” in §77p(b) are state-law class actions alleging securi-
  ties misconduct. Federal-law suits are not “class action[s] . . . as set
  forth in subsection (b).” Thus, they remain subject to the 1933 Act’s
  removal ban. This Court has held as much, concluding that §§77p(b)
  and 77p(c) apply to the exact same universe of class actions. Kircher,
  547 U. S., at 643–644. The “straightforward reading” of those two
  provisions is that removal under §77p(c) is “limited to those [actions]
  precluded by the terms of subsection (b).” Id., at 643. Pp. 18–24.

                                [March 20, 2018]

   JUSTICE KAGAN delivered the opinion of the Court.
   This case presents two questions about the Securities
Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 (SLUSA), 112
Stat. 3227. First, did SLUSA strip state courts of jurisdic-
tion over class actions alleging violations of only the Secu-
rities Act of 1933 (1933 Act), 48 Stat. 74, as amended, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">15</span>
<span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §77a et seq.? And second, even if not, did SLUSA
empower defendants to remove such actions from state to
federal court? We answer both questions no.

                             A

  In the wake of the 1929 stock market crash, Congress
enacted two laws, in successive years, to promote honest
practices in the securities markets. The 1933 Act required
companies offering securities to the public to make “full
and fair disclosure” of relevant information. Pinter v.
Dahl, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""112098""><a href=""/opinion/112098/pinter-v-dahl/""><span class=""volume"">486</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">622</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 646 (1988). And to aid enforcement of
those obligations, the statute created private rights of
action. Congress authorized both federal and state courts
to exercise jurisdiction over those private suits. See
§22(a), 48 Stat. 86 (“The district courts of the United
2        CYAN, INC. v. BEAVER COUNTY EMPLOYEES
                    RETIREMENT FUND                          

                      Opinion of the Court 


States . . . shall have jurisdiction[,] concurrent with State
and Territorial courts, of all suits in equity and actions at
law brought to enforce any liability or duty created by this
title”). More unusually, Congress also barred the removal
of such actions from state to federal court. Id., at 87 (“No
case arising under this title and brought in any State
court of competent jurisdiction shall be removed to any
court of the United States”). So if a plaintiff chose to bring
a 1933 Act suit in state court, the defendant could not
change the forum.
   Congress’s next foray, the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (1934 Act), operated differently. See 48 Stat. 881, as
amended, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">15</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §78a et seq. That statute regulated
not the original issuance of securities but instead all their
subsequent trading, most commonly on national stock
exchanges. See Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores,
</pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""109267""><a href=""/opinion/109267/blue-chip-stamps-v-manor-drug-stores/""><span class=""volume"">421</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">723</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 752 (1975). The 1934 Act, this Court held,
could also be enforced through private rights of action.
See id., at 730, and n. 4. But Congress determined that all
those suits should fall within the “exclusive jurisdiction” of
the federal courts. §27, 48 Stat. 902–903. So a plaintiff
could never go to state court to litigate a 1934 Act claim.
   In 1995, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
(Reform Act), 109 Stat. 737, amended both the 1933 and
the 1934 statutes in mostly identical ways. Congress
passed the Reform Act principally to stem “perceived
abuses of the class-action vehicle in litigation involving
nationally traded securities.” Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fen-
ner & Smith Inc. v. Dabit, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""145671""><a href=""/opinion/145671/merrill-lynch-pierce-fenner-smith-inc-v-dabit/""><span class=""volume"">547</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">71</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 81 (2006). Some of
the Reform Act’s provisions made substantive changes to
the 1933 and 1934 laws, and applied even when a 1933
Act suit was brought in state court. For instance, the
statute created a “safe harbor” from federal liability for
certain “forward-looking statements” made by company
officials. </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">15</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §77z–2 (1933 Act); §78u–5 (1934 Act).
Other Reform Act provisions modified the procedures used

                     Opinion of the Court

in litigating securities actions, and applied only when such
a suit was brought in federal court. To take one example,
the statute required a lead plaintiff in any class action
brought under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to file
a sworn certification stating, among other things, that he
had not purchased the relevant security “at the direction
of plaintiff ’s counsel.”     §77z–1(a)(2)(A)(ii) (1933 Act);
§78u–4(a)(2)(A)(ii) (1934 Act).
  But the Reform Act fell prey to the law of “unintended
consequence[s].” Dabit, 547 U. S., at 82. As this Court
previously described the problem: “Rather than face the
obstacles set in their path by the Reform Act, plaintiffs
and their representatives began bringing class actions
under state law.” Ibid. That “phenomenon was a novel
one”—and an unwelcome one as well. Ibid. To prevent
plaintiffs from circumventing the Reform Act, Congress
again undertook to modify both securities laws.
  The result was SLUSA, whose amendments to the 1933
Act are at issue in this case. Those amendments include,
as relevant here, two operative provisions, two associated
definitions, and two “conforming amendments” to the 1933
law’s jurisdictional section. 112 Stat. 3230. (SLUSA’s
amendments to the 1934 Act include essentially the same
operative provisions and definitions. See Dabit, 547 U. S.,
at 82, n. 6. But Congress decided that the 1934 law’s
exclusive jurisdiction provision needed no conforming
amendments.) The added material—now found in §§77p
and 77v(a) and set out in full in this opinion’s appendix—
goes as follows.
  First, §77p(b) altogether prohibits certain securities
class actions based on state law. That provision—which
we sometimes (and somewhat prosaically) refer to as the
state-law class-action bar—reads:
      “No covered class action based upon the statutory or
    common law of any State . . . may be maintained in
4        CYAN, INC. v. BEAVER COUNTY EMPLOYEES
                    RETIREMENT FUND                         

                      Opinion of the Court 


    any State or Federal court by any private party
    alleging—
    “(1) an untrue statement or omission of a material fact
    in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered
    security; or
    “(2) that the defendant used or employed any manipu-
    lative or deceptive device or contrivance in connection
    with the purchase or sale of a covered security.”
According to SLUSA’s definitions, the term “covered class
action” means a class action in which “damages are sought
on behalf of more than 50 persons.” §77p(f)(2). And the
term “covered security” refers to a security listed on a
national stock exchange.       §77p(f)(3) (cross-referencing
§77r(b)). So taken all in all, §77p(b) completely disallows
(in both state and federal courts) sizable class actions that
are founded on state law and allege dishonest practices
respecting a nationally traded security’s purchase or sale.
   Next, §77p(c) provides for the removal of certain class
actions to federal court, as well as for their subsequent
disposition:
      “Any covered class action brought in any State court
    involving a covered security, as set forth in subsection
    (b) of this section, shall be removable to the Federal
    district court for the district in which the action is
    pending, and shall be subject to subsection (b) of this
    section.”
The first chunk of that provision identifies the removable
cases, partly by way of a cross-reference (“as set forth in
subsection (b)”) to the just-described class-action bar. The
final clause of the provision (“and shall be subject to sub-
section (b)”) indicates what should happen to a barred
class suit after it has been removed: The “proper course is
to dismiss” the action. Kircher v. Putnam Funds Trust,
</pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""145645""><a href=""/opinion/145645/kircher-v-putnam-funds-trust/""><span class=""volume"">547</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">633</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 644 (2006). As this Court has explained,

                     Opinion of the Court

§77p(c) “avails a defendant of a federal forum in contem-
plation not of further litigation over the merits of a claim
brought in state court, but of termination of the proceed-
ings altogether.” Id., at 645, n. 12. The point of providing
that option, everyone here agrees, was to ensure the dis-
missal of a prohibited state-law class action even when a
state court “would not adequately enforce” §77p(b)’s bar.
Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 3; see Brief for
Petitioners 7; Brief for Respondents 20.
  Finally, the 1933 Act’s jurisdictional provision, codified
at §77v(a), now includes two new phrases framed as ex-
emptions—SLUSA’s self-described “conforming amend-
ments.” 112 Stat. 3230; see supra, at 3. The less signifi-
cant of the pair, for our purposes, reflects the allowance
for removing certain class actions described above.
Against the backdrop of the 1933 Act’s general removal
bar, see supra, at 2, that added (italicized) material reads:
    “Except as provided in section 77p(c) of this title, no
    case arising under this subchapter and brought in any
    State court of competent jurisdiction shall be removed
    to any court of the United States.”
The more important of the conforming amendments in this
case expresses a caveat to the general rule, see supra, at
1–2, that state and federal courts have concurrent juris-
diction over all claims to enforce the 1933 Act. As amended
(again, with the new material in italics), the relevant
sentence now reads:
    “The district courts of the United States . . . shall have
    jurisdiction[,] concurrent with State and Territorial
    courts, except as provided in section 77p of this title
    with respect to covered class actions, of all suits in eq-
    uity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability
    or duty created by this subchapter.”
Throughout this opinion, we refer to the italicized words

heart of the parties’ dispute in this Court.
                              B
   The petitioners in this case are Cyan, a telecommunica-
tions company, and its officers and directors (together,
Cyan). The respondents are three pension funds and an
individual (together, Investors) who purchased shares of
Cyan stock in an initial public offering. After the stock
declined in value, the Investors brought a damages class
action against Cyan in California Superior Court. Their
complaint alleges that Cyan’s offering documents con-
tained material misstatements, in violation of the 1933
Act. It does not assert any claims based on state law.
   Cyan moved to dismiss the Investors’ suit for lack of
subject matter jurisdiction. It argued that what we have
termed SLUSA’s “except clause”—i.e., the amendment
made to §77v(a)’s concurrent-jurisdiction grant—stripped
state courts of power to adjudicate 1933 Act claims in
“covered class actions.” The Investors did not dispute that
their suit qualifies as such an action under SLUSA’s
definition, see §77p(f )(2). But they maintained that
SLUSA left intact state courts’ jurisdiction over all suits—
including “covered class actions”—alleging only 1933 Act
claims. The California Superior Court agreed with the
Investors and denied Cyan’s motion to dismiss. See App.
to Pet. for Cert. 6a. The state appellate courts then denied
review of that ruling. See id., at 15a–16a.
   We granted Cyan’s petition for certiorari, 581 U. S. ___
(2017), to resolve a split among state and federal courts
about whether SLUSA deprived state courts of jurisdiction
over “covered class actions” asserting only 1933 Act
claims.1

                         Opinion of the Court

  In opposing Cyan’s jurisdictional position here, the
Federal Government as amicus curiae raised another
question: whether SLUSA enabled defendants to remove
1933 Act class actions from state to federal court for adju-
dication. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae
23–31. That question is not directly presented because
Cyan never attempted to remove the Investors’ suit. But
the removal issue is related to the parties’ jurisdictional
arguments, and both Cyan and the Investors addressed it
in briefing and argument. See Brief for Petitioners 39–40;
Brief for Respondents 31–35; Tr. of Arg. 31, 53–56, 74–76,
80. Accordingly, we consider as well the scope of §77p(c)’s
removal authorization.
                            II
  By its terms, §77v(a)’s “except clause” does nothing to
deprive state courts of their jurisdiction to decide class
actions brought under the 1933 Act. And Cyan’s various
appeals to SLUSA’s purposes and legislative history fail to
overcome the clear statutory language. The statute says
what it says—or perhaps better put here, does not say
what it does not say. State-court jurisdiction over 1933
Act claims thus continues undisturbed.2

                    RETIREMENT FUND                          

                      Opinion of the Court 


                                A
  SLUSA’s text, read most straightforwardly, leaves in
place state courts’ jurisdiction over 1933 Act claims, in-
cluding when brought in class actions. Recall that the
background rule of §77v(a)—in place since the 1933 Act’s
passage—gives state courts concurrent jurisdiction over
all suits “brought to enforce any liability or duty created
by” that statute. See supra, at 1–2. The except clause—
once again, “except as provided in section 77p of this title
with respect to covered class actions”—is drafted as a
limitation on that rule: It ensures that in any case in
which §77v(a) and §77p come into conflict, §77p will con-
trol. The critical question for this case is therefore whether
§77p limits state-court jurisdiction over class actions
brought under the 1933 Act. It does not. As earlier de-
scribed, §77p bars certain securities class actions based on
state law. See §77p(b); supra, at 3–4. And as a corollary of
that prohibition, it authorizes removal of those suits so
that a federal court can dismiss them. See §77p(c); supra,
at 4–5. But the section says nothing, and so does nothing,
to deprive state courts of jurisdiction over class actions
based on federal law. That means the background rule of
§77v(a)—under which a state court may hear the Inves-
tors’ 1933 Act suit—continues to govern.
   Cyan offers an alternative reading, in which one of
SLUSA’s definitional provisions works to alter state-court
jurisdiction. According to Cyan, the except clause’s refer-
ence to “covered class actions” points the reader to, and
only to, §77p(f )(2)’s definition of that term. See Brief for
Petitioners 16. And that definition states that a “covered
class action” is a suit seeking damages on behalf of more
than 50 persons—without mentioning anything about
whether the suit is based on state or federal law. Cyan
thus concludes that the except clause exempts all sizable
class actions—including the Investors’ suit—from
                      Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)                     9

                          Opinion of the Court

§77v(a)’s conferral of jurisdiction on state courts.
   But that view cannot be squared with the except
clause’s wording for two independent reasons. To start
with, the except clause points to “section 77p” as a whole—
not to paragraph 77p(f )(2). Cyan wants to cherry pick
from the material covered by the statutory cross-reference.
But if Congress had intended to refer to the definition in
§77p(f )(2) alone, it presumably would have done so—just
by adding a letter, a number, and a few parentheticals. As
this Court recently explained, “Congress often drafts
statutes with hierarchical schemes—section, subsection,
paragraph, and on down the line.” NLRB v. SW General,
Inc., </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">580</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 9). And “[w]hen
Congress want[s] to refer only to a particular subsection or
paragraph, it sa[ys] so.” Ibid. It said no such thing in the
except clause.
   In any event, the definitional paragraph on which Cyan
relies cannot be read to “provide[ ]” an “except[ion]” to the
rule of concurrent jurisdiction, in the way SLUSA’s except
clause requires. A definition does not provide an excep-
tion, but instead gives meaning to a term—and Congress
well knows the difference between those two functions.
Thousands of statutory provisions use the phrase “except
as provided in . . .” followed by a cross-reference in order to
indicate that one rule should prevail over another in any
circumstance in which the two conflict; we count more
than 30 such constructions in the 1933 and 1934 Acts
alone.3    Not one of those 30-plus provisions cross-

                         Opinion of the Court 


references a definition; nor has Cyan pointed to a single
such example from the whole rest of the U. S. Code. And
the Congress enacting SLUSA had no reason to attempt
that peculiar maneuver for the first time. If Congress had
wanted to deprive state courts of jurisdiction over 1933
Act class actions, it had an easy way to do so: just insert
into §77p an exclusive federal jurisdiction provision (like
the 1934 Act’s) for such suits. That rule, when combined
with the except clause, would have done the trick because
it would have “provided” an “except[ion]” to §77v(a)’s grant
of concurrent jurisdiction; by contrast, a mere definition of
“covered class action” (as a damages suit on behalf of 50-
plus people) does not so provide.
   SLUSA’s other conforming amendment illustrates the
two ways in which Cyan’s construction of the except clause
departs from its language. Recall that §77v(a) includes a
general bar on removal. See supra, at 2. And recall that
SLUSA appended to that prohibition the phrase “[e]xcept
as provided in section 77p(c)” to reflect the statute’s new
permission to remove certain class actions. See supra,
at 5. In that “except as provided” phrase—just four sen-
tences down from the except clause central to this case—
Congress pinpointed a subsection of §77p, rather than
citing the entire section for only one of its parts. Still
more, that cross-referenced subsection contains an opera-
tive provision that could limit a rule, rather than a mere
definition of a statutory term. In short, Congress wrote
the removal bar’s except clause in just the way a reader of
legislation would expect—and not in the wholly irregular
way Cyan proposes for the except clause at issue here.
Especially given the two provisions’ “interrelationship and
close proximity,” Commissioner v. Lundy, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""117992""><a href=""/opinion/117992/commissioner-v-lundy/""><span class=""volume"">516</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">235</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">,

                      Opinion of the Court

   Cyan’s interpretation also fits poorly with the remainder
of the statutory scheme. Because Cyan treats the broad
definition of “covered class action” as altering §77v(a)’s
jurisdictional grant, its construction would prevent state
courts from deciding any 1933 Act class suits seeking
damages for more than 50 plaintiffs. That would include
suits not involving a “covered security”—i.e., a security
traded on a national stock exchange. §77p(f )(3); Brief for
Petitioners 29 (conceding that point). But this Court has
emphasized that SLUSA’s operative provisions (including
its state-law class-action bar, see §77p(b)) apply to only
“transactions in covered securities”: The statute “ex-
presses no concern” with “transactions in uncovered securi-
ties”—precisely because they are not traded on national
markets. Chadbourne & Parke LLP v. Troice, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">571</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span>
<span class=""page"">377</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, ___ (2014) (slip. op., at 9); see Brief for United States
as Amicus Curiae 16–17 (SLUSA does not regard suits
involving uncovered securities as “a matter of distinct
federal concern”). Those securities, the Court explained,
are “primarily of state concern,” and SLUSA “maintains
state legal authority” to address them. Chadbourne, 571
U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13). Except that under Cyan’s
view, SLUSA would not. Instead, the law would strip
state courts of jurisdiction over suits about securities
raising no particular national interest. That result is out
of line with SLUSA’s overall scope.
   And finally, Cyan’s take on the except clause reads too
much into a mere “conforming amendment.” 112 Stat.
3230. The change Cyan claims that clause made to state-
court jurisdiction is the very opposite of a minor tweak.
When Congress passed SLUSA, state courts had for 65
years adjudicated all manner of 1933 Act cases, including
class actions. Indeed, defendants could not even remove
those cases to federal court, as schemes of concurrent
jurisdiction almost always allow. See supra, at 2. State
courts thus had as much or more power over the 1933

Act’s enforcement as over any federal statute’s. To think
Cyan right, we would have to believe that Congress up-
ended that entrenched practice not by any direct means,
but instead by way of a conforming amendment to §77v(a)
(linked, in its view, with only a definition). But Congress
does not make “radical—but entirely implicit—change[s]”
through “technical and conforming amendments.” Direc-

yet one more reason to reject Cyan’s view of SLUSA’s text.
                             B
  Faced with such recalcitrant statutory language, Cyan
stakes much of its case on legislative purpose and history.
See Brief for Petitioners 20–33, 36–37; Reply Brief 7–11,
17–21. Its claims come in two forms—one relating to the
goals of SLUSA as a whole and the other relating to the
aims of the except clause. Even assuming clear text can
ever give way to purpose, Cyan would need some monster
arguments on this score to create doubts about SLUSA’s
meaning. The points Cyan raises come nowhere close to
that level.
                              1
  According to Cyan’s broad purposive argument, Con-
gress could not “make good on the promise of the Reform
Act”—which was its principal intention in enacting
SLUSA—without divesting state courts of jurisdiction over
all sizable 1933 Act class actions. Brief for Petitioners 20.
Remember that the Reform Act contained a number of
procedural measures (for example, a sworn-certification
requirement for lead plaintiffs, see §77z–1(a)(2)(A)) that
                  Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)           13

                      Opinion of the Court

apply only in federal court. See supra, at 2–3. Plaintiffs
bringing 1933 Act class actions could avoid those provi-
sions simply by filing in state court; after all, those suits
were not even removable by defendants. “So,” Cyan
claims, “Congress enacted SLUSA to finish the job”—by
shutting down the state forum and shifting all 1933 Act
class actions to the federal one. Brief for Petitioners 21.
In support of that view, Cyan cites several statements in
SLUSA’s legislative reports—in particular, that SLUSA’s
purpose was “to prevent plaintiffs from seeking to evade
the protections that Federal law provides against abusive
litigation by filing suit in State, rather than in Federal,
court.” H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 105–803, p. 13 (1998); see
H. R. Rep. No. 105–640, pp. 8–9 (1998); S. Rep. No. 105–
182, p. 3 (1998).
   But to begin with, Cyan ignores a different way in which
SLUSA “serve[d] the [Reform Act’s] objectives,” Brief for
Petitioners 11—which our view of the statute fully effects.
Recall that the Reform Act also included substantive
sections protecting defendants (like a safe harbor for
forward-looking statements) in suits brought under the
federal securities laws. See §77z–2; supra, at 2. Plaintiffs
could—and did—avoid those provisions by bringing their
complaints of securities misconduct under state law in-
stead. See supra, at 3. Hence emerged SLUSA’s bar on
state-law class actions (and its removal provision to en-
sure their dismissal)—which guaranteed that the Reform
Act’s heightened substantive standards would govern all
future securities class litigation. SLUSA itself highlights
that aim: Its preamble states that the statute is designed
“to limit the conduct of securities class actions under State
law, and for other purposes.” 112 Stat. 3227. So too, this
Court has underscored, over and over, SLUSA’s “purpose
to preclude certain vexing state-law class actions.”

Plans and Trust Funds, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">568</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">455</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 476 (2013) (SLUSA
“curtailed plaintiffs’ ability to evade the [Reform Act] by
bringing class-action suits under state rather than federal
law”). That object—which SLUSA’s text actually re-
flects—does not depend on stripping state courts of juris-
diction over 1933 Act class suits, as Cyan proposes. For
wherever those suits go forward, the Reform Act’s sub-
stantive protections necessarily apply.
   Still more, SLUSA ensured that federal courts would
play the principal role in adjudicating securities class
actions by means of its revisions to the 1934 Act. As
explained earlier, SLUSA amended that statute in the
same main way it did the 1933 Act—by adding a state-law
class-action bar. See §78bb(f )(1); supra, at 3. But there,
the change had a double effect: Because federal courts
have exclusive jurisdiction over 1934 Act claims, forcing
plaintiffs to bring class actions under the 1934 statute
instead of state law also forced them to file in federal
court. That meant the bulk of securities class actions
would proceed in federal court—because the 1934 Act
regulates all trading of securities whereas the 1933 Act
addresses only securities offerings.        See Blue Chip
Stamps, 421 U. S., at 752 (characterizing the 1933 Act as
“a far narrower statute”). So even without Cyan’s con-
trived reading of the except clause, SLUSA largely accom-
plished the purpose articulated in its Conference Report:
moving securities class actions to federal court.
   To be sure, “largely” does not mean “entirely”—but then
again, we do not generally expect statutes to fulfill 100%
of all of their goals. See, e.g., Freeman v. Quicken Loans,
Inc., </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">566</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">624</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 637 (2012) (“No legislation pursues its

ations omitted)). Under our reading of SLUSA, all covered

                      Opinion of the Court

federal court; some (i.e., those alleging 1933 Act claims)
may proceed in state court. We do not know why Congress
declined to require as well that 1933 Act class actions be
brought in federal court; perhaps it was because of the
long and unusually pronounced tradition of according
authority to state courts over 1933 Act litigation. See
supra, at 11–12. But in any event, we will not revise that
legislative choice, by reading a conforming amendment
and a definition in a most improbable way, in an effort to
make the world of securities litigation more consistent or
pure. This Court has long rejected the notion that “what-
ever furthers the statute’s primary objective must be the
law.” Rodriguez v. United States, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""111840""><a href=""/opinion/111840/rodriguez-v-united-states/""><span class=""volume"">480</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">522</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 526

                                2
   Yet Cyan has a final argument—that the except clause
would serve no purpose at all unless it works as Cyan
says. See Brief for Petitioners 32–33; Reply Brief 8–11.
Here, Cyan relies on an indubitable puzzle. Section
77v(a), as amended by SLUSA, gives state courts jurisdic-
tion over 1933 Act suits “except as provided in §77p.” But
§77p provides a bar on only certain state-law suits. So,
Cyan contends, unless we take up its invitation to look to
§77p(f )(2)’s definition of “covered class action,” the except
clause excepts “exactly nothing.” Reply Brief 8. (To use
an example of our own, it would be as if a parent told her
child “you may have fruit after dinner, except for lolli-
pops.”) What on earth, Cyan asks, would be the point of
such a provision?
   The Investors answer that question with a theory about
why Congress enacted the except clause. In their view,
16       CYAN, INC. v. BEAVER COUNTY EMPLOYEES 

                    RETIREMENT FUND                         

                      Opinion of the Court 


the clause was meant to deal with “mixed” securities class
actions—containing both claims brought under the 1933
Act and claims arising under state law. See Brief for
Respondents 12–13. If not for the except clause, the In-
vestors posit, state courts would have been uncertain
about how to handle those suits. Section 77p clearly
instructs courts not to adjudicate the state-law claims; but
(the Investors continue) §77v(a) gives state courts jurisdic-
tion over entire “actions” brought to enforce the 1933 Act,
even if they include additional state-law claims. What,
then, to do? According to the Investors, the except clause’s
purpose was to resolve that statutory conflict by making
clear that §77p trumps §77v(a)—in other words, that a
state court may not entertain state-law claims precluded
by §77p(b) even when they are conjoined with 1933 Act
claims falling within §77v(a)’s grant of jurisdiction.
   Truth be told, we are not sure whether Congress had
that issue in mind. On the one hand (and contrary to
what the Investors say), we doubt that the except clause
was really necessary to address mixed class actions. Even
without that clause, a competent state court faced with
such a suit would understand that §77p requires dismissal
of the state-law claims—and that §77v(a)’s jurisdictional
grant over 1933 Act suits is not to the contrary. But on
the other hand (and now supporting the Investors’ princi-
pal point), Congress may have thought that class-action
lawyers would still try to circumvent SLUSA by tacking a
1933 Act claim onto a forbidden state-law class action, on
the off chance of finding an error-prone judge. (After all,
the worst that could happen was that the court would
throw out the state-law claims, leaving the plaintiff with a
permissible 1933 Act suit.) To prevent such gamesman-
ship—to make clear beyond peradventure that courts
could not entertain the state-law half of mixed class ac-

suits, it could well have added the except clause in a more
general excess of caution—to safeguard §77p’s class-action
bar come whatever might. This Court has encountered
many examples of Congress legislating in that hyper-
vigilant way, to “remov[e] any doubt” as to things not
particularly doubtful in the first instance. Marx v. Gen-
eral Revenue Corp., </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">568</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">371</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 383–384 (2013) (citing

(The idea, to return to our prior example, is to make sure
that even if the child thinks orange lollipops count as fruit,
she will not act on that view.) And if ever Congress had
reason to legislate in that fashion, it was in SLUSA—
whose very impetus lay in the success of class-action
attorneys in “bypass[ing] . . . the Reform Act.” Kircher,
547 U. S., at 636. Heedful of that history of machinations,
Congress may have determined to eliminate any risk—
even if unlikely or at the time unknown—that a pre-
existing grant of power to state courts could be used to
obstruct SLUSA’s new limitation on what they could
decide. And so (this alternative explanation goes) Con-
gress enacted the except clause—which, in insisting that
the limitation prevailed, would function as the ultimate
(though with any luck, unneeded) fail-safe device.4
——————
  4 In line with this precautionary function, the except clause could do

some work to protect §77p’s state-law class-action bar in a set of suits
beyond mixed cases. As this Court recently noted, some state-law
securities claims “rise[ ] or fall[ ] on the plaintiff ’s ability to prove the
violation” of a federal securities statute. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner
& Smith Inc. v. Manning, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">578</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 7)
(addressing the 1934 Act). In such cases, we held, the state-law claims
are “brought to enforce” a liability created by the federal statute, and
thus fall within that law’s jurisdictional provision. See id., at ___ (slip
op., at 8). In the absence of the except clause, then, class-action law-
yers might well have argued that such state-law claims could be adju-
dicated under §77v(a) notwithstanding §77p’s bar. Once again, we
think most courts would have rejected that claim and decided that §77p

                       Opinion of the Court 


   But the most important response to this purposive
argument echoes what we have said before about the
weaknesses of Cyan’s own construction of the except
clause. In the end, the uncertainty surrounding Con-
gress’s reasons for drafting that clause does not matter.
Nor does the possibility that the risk Congress addressed
(whether specific or inchoate) did not exist. Because irre-
spective of those points, we have no sound basis for giving
the except clause a broader reading than its language can
bear. And that is especially true in light of the dramatic
change such an interpretation would work in the 1933
Act’s jurisdictional framework. Whatever questions re-
main as to the except clause’s precise purpose—and we do
not gainsay there are some—they do not give us permis-
sion to devise a statute (and at that, a transformative one)
of our own.
                             III
   Our last task is to address the Federal Government’s
proposed halfway-house position. The Government rejects
Cyan’s view that SLUSA stripped state courts of jurisdic-
tion over 1933 Act class actions, for roughly the same
reasons we have given. See Brief for United States as
Amicus Curiae 11–23. But like Cyan, the Government
believes that “Congress would not have been content to
leave” such suits “stuck in state court,” where the Reform
Act’s procedural protections do not apply. Id., at 15 (in-
ternal quotation marks omitted). So the Government
offers a reading of SLUSA—in particular, of §77p(c)—that
would allow defendants to remove 1933 Act class actions
to federal court, as long as they allege the kinds of mis-
conduct listed in §77p(b) (e.g., false statements or decep-
tive devices in connection with a covered security’s pur-

controls—but the except clause eliminates any chance of a contrary 

holding.

chase or sale). See id., at 24–25.
  But most naturally read, §77p(c)—SLUSA’s exception to
the 1933 Act’s general bar on removal—refutes, not sup-
ports, the Government’s view. Once again, see supra, at 4,
§77p(c) reads as follows:
    “Any covered class action brought in any State court
    involving a covered security, as set forth in subsection
    (b) of this section, shall be removable to the Federal
    district court for the district in which the action is
    pending, and shall be subject to subsection (b) of this
    section.”
In other words, the covered class actions described in
§77p(b) can be removed to federal court (and, once there,
shall be subject to dismissal because precluded, see supra,
at 5). And which are the covered class actions described in
§77p(b)? By this point, no one should have to be reminded:
They are state-law class actions alleging securities mis-
conduct. See §77p(b) (prohibiting “class action[s] based
upon the statutory or common law of any State”). So those
state-law suits are removable. But conversely, federal-law
suits like this one—alleging only 1933 Act claims—are not
“class action[s] . . . as set forth in subsection (b).” So they
remain subject to the 1933 Act’s removal ban.
   In fact, this Court already held as much, by concluding
in Kircher that §§77p(b) and 77p(c) apply to the exact
same universe of class actions. See 547 U. S., at 643–644.
Kircher involved a securities suit that was unaffected by
§77p(b)’s class-action bar—there, not because it was based
on federal law but because it involved a form of conduct
falling outside that subsection. The Court of Appeals
decided that the suit could be removed under §77p(c) even
though it was not precluded by §77p(b), thinking (as we
later put it) that the removal issue and “the preclusion
issue [were] distinct.” Id., at 638. We flatly rejected that
understanding of the relationship between §77p(b) and
20         CYAN, INC. v. BEAVER COUNTY EMPLOYEES

                        Opinion of the Court 


§77p(c). The “straightforward reading” of those two provi-
sions, we explained, is that removal is “limited to those
[actions] precluded by the terms of subsection (b).” Id., at
643. And if that were not clear enough, we said it again:
Removal under §77p(c) is “restricted to precluded actions
defined by subsection (b).” Id., at 643–644. And just to
pound the point home, we said it yet a third time: “A
covered [class] action is removable if it is precluded.” Id.,
at 646. Kircher thus forecloses the Government’s argu-
ment. Section 77p(b) does not preclude federal-law class
actions. So under our decision, §77p(c) does not authorize
their removal.5
  The Government responds with a novel way of under-
standing §77p(c), which it thinks would allow us to disre-
gard Kircher when a class action like this one is based on
federal law. In the Government’s view, first presented at
oral argument, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 32–33, the words “as
set forth in subsection (b)” do not modify the entire preced-
ing phrase (basically, any large class action involving a
covered security). Instead, the Government claims, those
words modify only the shorter phrase “involving a covered
security.” To support that view, the Government invokes
the “rule of the last antecedent”—under which “the limit-
ing clause is most naturally applied to the thing that
comes immediately before it.” Id., at 36. The Government

  5 In light of SLUSA’s text and Kircher’s holding, it should come as no

surprise that all seven Courts of Appeals to have considered the matter
have concluded that §77p(c) allows removal of only class actions falling
within §77p(b)’s prohibition. See Campbell v. American Int’l Group,

                     Opinion of the Court

then presents a theory of how subsection (b) “set[s] forth”
the “involv[ement]” of a covered security. “[T]o figure out
what that means,” the Government contends, “you look at
[§77p](b)(1) and (b)(2), which talk about certain types of
misconduct”—for example, false statements or deceptive
devices in connection with a covered security’s sale. Id., at
33–34. As long as conduct of that kind is implicated in a
suit, the Government concludes, it can be removed—even
if it is based on federal law and thus does not fall within
§77p(b) as a whole. That view is consistent with Kircher’s
result because the action there did not involve the conduct
described in §§77p(b)(1) and (2). And as to Kircher’s ra-
tionale . . . well, we should feel free to ignore it.
   But even putting aside respect for precedent, that ar-
gument is in many ways flawed. To start with, the Gov-
ernment provides no good reason to think that “as set
forth in subsection (b)” modifies only the phrase “involving
a covered security.” As stated above, the most natural
way to view the modifier is as applying to the entire pre-
ceding clause—again, “[a]ny covered class action brought
in any State court involving a covered security.” See
supra, at 19. That is so because that clause hangs together
as a unified whole, referring to a single thing (a type of
class action). Consider the following, grammatically iden-
tical construction: “The woman dressed to the nines carry-
ing an umbrella, as shown in the picture . . .” Would
anyone think that “as shown in the picture” referred to
anything less than the well-attired and rain-ready woman?
No. And so too here, the modifier goes back to the begin-
ning of the preceding clause. The rule of the last anteced-
ent is not to the contrary. We have applied that rule when
the alternative reading would “stretch[ ] the modifier too
far” by asking it to qualify a remote or otherwise discon-
nected phrase. Jama v. Immigration and Customs En-
forcement, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""137740""><a href=""/opinion/137740/jama-v-immigration-and-customs-enforcement/""><span class=""volume"">543</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">335</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 342 (2005); Lockhart v.

rule “where it takes more than a little mental energy to
process” a statute’s component parts, “making it a heavy
lift to carry the modifier across them all”).6 By contrast,
we have not applied the rule when the modifier directly
follows a concise and “integrated” clause. Jama, 543 U. S.,
at 344, n. 4. As it does here.
   But let us assume that the rule of the last antecedent
governs: The Government then misapplies it by attaching
the modifier to something more than the last thing before
it. The rule, correctly used, would insist that “as set forth
in subsection (b)” modifies only “a covered security”—
because that is the closest “noun or noun phrase” that the
modifier could reasonably reference. A. Scalia & B. Gar-
ner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 144
(2012) (quoting R. Burchfield, Fowler’s Modern English
Usage (3d ed. 1996)). But that standard way of applying
the rule would not aid the Government’s construction, so it
goes back yet another word: It attaches “as set forth in
subsection (b)” to the longer phrase—and a verb phrase at
that—“involving a covered security.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 35.
That maneuver has no grammatical basis. (It is as if, in
the example offered above, someone claimed that “as
shown in the picture” modified not the woman, nor even
the umbrella, but instead the in-between verb phrase
“carrying an umbrella.”) The Government is choosing
where to start in the sentence (that is, which words to

  6 The classic example comes from Barnhart v. Thomas, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""131145""><a href=""/opinion/131145/barnhart-v-thomas/""><span class=""volume"">540</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">20</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">
(2003). The statute at issue provided that a person is disabled if his
impairment is so severe that “he is not only unable to do his previous
work but cannot, considering his age, education, and work experience,
engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the
national economy.” Id., at 23 (quoting </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">42</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §423(d)(1)(A)) (em-
phasis altered). Invoking the rule of the last antecedent, we concluded
that the italicized phrase “which exists in the national economy”
modifies only “substantial gainful work,” and not the more distant
“previous work.” See 540 U. S., at 26. Needless to say, that statutory
provision is a far cry from the one at issue here.

qualify) based only on what best serves its argument.
  But let us even assume that “as set forth in subsection
(b)” modifies “involving a covered security”: The language
would still fail to explain the Government’s position.
Remember that the Government reads the resulting
phrase (again, “involving a covered security, as set forth in
subsection (b)”) to point only to the forms of wrongful
conduct listed in §§77p(b)(1) and (2)—for example, false
statements or deceptive devices in securities sales. See
supra, at 21. The problem is that no one would describe
those misdeeds with that phrase. If Congress had meant
to refer only to that behavior, rather than to everything in
§77p(b), it would have done two things differently. First,
Congress would have written “as set forth in paragraphs
(b)(1) and (b)(2)” instead of “as set forth in subsection (b)”
as a whole. See supra, at 9 (explaining that when Con-
gress wants to refer only to a particular subsection or
paragraph, it says so). And second, Congress would have
written something like “involving allegations of miscon-
duct,” rather than “involving a covered security”—because
the latter phrase does not even passably describe
§§77(b)(1) and (2)’s catalog of vices. We will not read
“involving a covered security, as set forth in subsection
(b)” to mean “involving allegations of misconduct, as set
forth in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2)” when Congress did
not enact that formulation. See Lozano v. Montoya Alva-
rez, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">572</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">1, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 14) (“Given that the
drafters did not adopt that alternative, the natural impli-
cation is that they did not intend” to do so).
  And (finally, we promise) even if we could put out of
mind all these difficulties, the Government’s position runs
aground on §77p(c)’s last clause, which states that re-
moved class actions “shall be subject to subsection (b).”
That clause, properly understood, points toward dismissal
of a removed action. As we earlier explained, and the
Government concedes, Congress enacted §77p(c)’s removal

provision out of “concern[ ] that state courts would not
adequately enforce” §77p(b)’s state-law class-action prohi-
bition. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 3; see
supra, at 5. The idea was to allow removal so that a fed-
eral court could act as a backstop and order a class action’s
dismissal—thereby “subject[ing]” it to §77p(b)’s bar.
Kircher specifically said as much: Section 77p(c) “avails a
defendant of a federal forum in contemplation not of fur-
ther litigation over the merits of a claim brought in state
court, but of termination of the proceedings altogether.”
547 U. S., at 645, n. 12; see supra, at 5. But of course, the
Government contemplates “further litigation”—not “ter-
mination”—of a removed 1933 Act class action. See Brief
for United States as Amicus Curiae 25. That decoupling of
§77p(c)’s linkage between removal and dismissal provides
the last reason to reject the Government’s argument.
   At bottom, the Government makes the same mistake as
Cyan: It distorts SLUSA’s text because it thinks Congress
simply must have wanted 1933 Act class actions to be
litigated in federal court. But this Court has no license
to “disregard clear language” based on an in-
tuition that “Congress must have intended something
broader.” Bay Mills, 572 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11)
(internal quotation marks omitted). SLUSA did quite a
bit to “make good on the promise of the Reform Act” (as
Cyan puts it). Brief for Petitioners 20; see supra, at 12–
13. If further steps are needed, they are up to Congress.
                            IV
  SLUSA did nothing to strip state courts of their
longstanding jurisdiction to adjudicate class actions alleg-
ing only 1933 Act violations. Neither did SLUSA author-
ize removing such suits from state to federal court. We
accordingly affirm the judgment below.

                                             It is so ordered.

 CYAN, INC., ET AL. v. BEAVER COUNTY EMPLOYEES
             RETIREMENT FUND ET AL.

    CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEAL OF CALIFORNIA,

                FIRST APPELLATE DISTRICT


  No. 15–1439. Argued November 28, 2017—Decided March 20, 2018
In the wake of the 1929 stock market crash, Congress enacted two laws,
  in successive years, to promote honest practices in the securities
  markets. The Securities Act of 1933 (1933 Act) creates private rights
  of action to aid the enforcement of obligations pertaining to securities
  offerings. The Act authorizes both federal and state courts to exer-
  cise jurisdiction over those private suits and, more unusually, bars
  the removal of such suits from state to federal court. The Securities
  Exchange Act of 1934 (1934 Act), which regulates not the original is-
  suance of securities but all their subsequent trading, is also enforcea-
  ble through private rights of action. But all suits brought under the
  1934 Act fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts.
     In 1995, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (Reform Act)
  amended both Acts, in order to stem perceived abuses of the class-
  action vehicle in securities litigation. The Reform Act included both
  substantive reforms, applicable in state and federal court alike, and
  procedural reforms, applicable only in federal court. Rather than
  face these new obstacles, plaintiffs began filing securities class ac-
  tions under state law.
     To prevent this end run around the Reform Act, Congress passed
  the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 (SLUSA),
  whose amendments to the 1933 Act are at issue in this case. As rele-
  vant here, those amendments include two operative provisions, two
  associated definitions, and two “conforming amendments.”
     First, 15 U. S. C. §77p(b) completely disallows (in both state and
  federal courts) “covered class actions” alleging dishonest practices “in
  connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.” Accord-
  ing to SLUSA’s definitions, the term “covered class action” means a
2            CYAN, INC. v. BEAVER COUNTY EMPLOYEES

                              Syllabus


    class action in which “damages are sought on behalf of more than 50
    persons.” §77p(f)(2). And the term “covered security” refers to a se-
    curity listed on a national stock exchange. §77p(f)(3). Next, §77p(c)
    provides for the removal of certain class actions to federal court,
    where they are subject to dismissal. Finally, SLUSA’s “conforming
    amendments” add two new phrases to §77v(a), the 1933 Act’s juris-
    dictional provision. The first creates an exception to §77v(a)’s gen-
    eral removal bar through the language “[e]xcept as provided in sec-
    tion 77p(c).” The other—the key provision in this case—expresses a
    caveat to the general rule that state and federal courts have concur-
    rent jurisdiction over all claims to enforce the 1933 Act. With this
    conforming amendment, §77v(a) now provides that state and federal
    courts shall have concurrent jurisdiction, “except as provided in sec-
    tion 77p . . . with respect to covered class actions.” The Court refers
    to this provision as the “except clause.”
       Respondents, three pension funds and an individual (Investors),
    purchased shares of stock in petitioner Cyan, Inc., in an initial public
    offering. After the stock declined in value, the Investors brought a
    damages class action against Cyan in state court, alleging 1933 Act
    violations. They did not assert any claims based on state law. Cyan
    moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, arguing that
    SLUSA’s “except clause” stripped state courts of power to adjudicate
    1933 Act claims in “covered class actions.” The Investors maintained
    that SLUSA left intact state courts’ jurisdiction over all suits—
    including “covered class actions”—alleging only 1933 Act claims. The
    state courts agreed with the Investors and denied Cyan’s motion to
    dismiss. This Court granted certiorari to decide whether SLUSA de-
    prived state courts of jurisdiction over “covered class actions” assert-
    ing only 1933 Act claims. The Court also addresses a related ques-
    tion raised by the federal Government as amicus curiae and
    addressed by the parties in briefing and argument: whether SLUSA
    enabled defendants to remove 1933 Act class actions from state to
    federal court for adjudication.
Held:
    1. SLUSA did nothing to strip state courts of their longstanding ju-
 risdiction to adjudicate class actions brought under the 1933 Act.
 Pp. 7–18.
       (a) SLUSA’s text, read most straightforwardly, leaves this juris-
 diction intact. The background rule of §77v(a)—in place since the
 1933 Act’s passage—gives state courts concurrent jurisdiction over all
 suits “brought to enforce any liability or duty created by” that stat-
 ute. And the except clause—“except as provided in section 77p of this
 title with respect to covered class actions”—ensures that in any case
 in which §77v(a) and §77p conflict, §77p will control. The critical
                    Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)                      3

                               Syllabus

question for this case is therefore whether §77p limits state-court ju-
risdiction over class actions brought under the 1933 Act. It does not.
Section 77p bars certain securities class actions based on state law
but it says nothing, and so does nothing, to deprive state courts of ju-
risdiction over class actions based on federal law. That means
§77v(a)’s background rule—under which a state court may hear the
Investors’ 1933 Act suit—continues to govern.
   Cyan argues that the except clause’s reference to “covered class ac-
tions” points the reader to §77p(f)(2), which defines that term to
mean a suit seeking damages on behalf of more than fifty persons—
without mentioning anything about whether the suit is based on
state or federal law. But that view cannot be squared with the except
clause’s wording for two independent reasons. First, the except
clause points to “section 77p” as a whole—not to paragraph 77p(f)(2).
Had Congress intended to refer to §77p(f)(2)’s definition alone, it pre-
sumably would have done so. See NLRB v. SW General, Inc., 580
U. S. ___, ___. Second, a definition, like §77p(f)(2), does not “pro-
vide[]” an “except[ion],” but instead gives meaning to a term—and
Congress well knows the difference between those two functions. Not
one of the 30-plus provisions in the 1933 and 1934 Acts using the
phrase “except as provided in . . .” cross-references a definition.
   Structure and context also support the Court’s reading of the ex-
cept clause. Because Cyan treats the broad definition of “covered
class action” as altering §77v(a)’s jurisdictional grant, its construction
would prevent state courts from deciding any 1933 Act class suits
seeking damages for more than fifty plaintiffs, thus stripping state
courts of jurisdiction over suits about securities raising no particular
national interest. That result is out of line with SLUSA’s overall
scope. Moreover, it is highly unlikely that Congress upended the 65-
year practice of state courts’ adjudicating all manner of 1933 Act cas-
es (including class actions) by way of a mere conforming amendment.
See Director of Revenue of Mo. v. CoBank ACB, 531 U. S. 316, 324.
Pp. 8–12.
     (b) Cyan’s reliance on legislative purpose and history is unavail-
ing. Pp. 12–18.
       (1) Cyan insists that the only way for SLUSA to serve the Re-
form Act’s objectives was by divesting state courts of jurisdiction over
all sizable 1933 Act class actions. Specifically, it claims that its read-
ing is necessary to prevent plaintiffs from circumventing the Reform
Act’s procedural measures, which apply only in federal court, by
bringing 1933 Act class actions in state court.
   But Cyan ignores a different way in which SLUSA served the Re-
form Act’s objectives—which the Court’s view of the statute fully ef-
fects. The Reform Act included substantive sections protecting de-
4            CYAN, INC. v. BEAVER COUNTY EMPLOYEES
                        RETIREMENT FUND                                    

                              Syllabus


    fendants in suits brought under the federal securities laws. Plaintiffs
    circumvented those provisions by bringing their complaints of securi-
    ties misconduct under state law instead. Hence emerged SLUSA’s
    bar on state-law class actions (and its removal provision to ensure
    their dismissal)—which guaranteed that the Reform Act’s heightened
    substantive standards would govern all future securities class litiga-
    tion. SLUSA’s preamble states that the statute is designed “to limit
    the conduct of securities class actions under state law, and for other
    purposes,” 112 Stat. 3227, and this Court has underscored, over and
    over, SLUSA’s “purpose to preclude certain vexing state-law class ac-
    tions.” Kircher v. Putnam Funds Trust, 547 U. S. 633, 645, n. 12.
    That object—which SLUSA’s text actually reflects—does not depend
    on stripping state courts of jurisdiction over 1933 Act class suits, as
    Cyan proposes. For wherever those suits go forward, the Reform
    Act’s substantive protections necessarily apply.
        SLUSA also went a good distance toward ensuring that federal
    courts would play the principal role in adjudicating securities class
    actions by means of its revisions to the 1934 Act. Because federal
    courts have exclusive jurisdiction over 1934 Act claims, forcing plain-
    tiffs to bring class actions under the 1934 statute instead of state law
    also forced them to file in federal court. Pp. 12–15.
            (2) Cyan finally argues that the except clause would serve no
    purpose at all unless it works as Cyan says. But Congress could have
    envisioned the except clause as the ultimate fail-safe device, designed
    to safeguard §77p’s class-action bar come whatever might. Congress
    has been known to legislate in that hyper-vigilant way, to “remov[e]
    any doubt” as to things not particularly doubtful in the first instance.
    Marx v. General Revenue Corp., 568 U. S. 371, 383–384. If ever it
    had reason to legislate in that fashion, it was in SLUSA—whose very
    impetus lay in the success of class action attorneys in “bypass[ing]
    . . . the Reform Act.” Kircher, 547 U. S., at 636. And regardless of
    any uncertainty surrounding Congress’s reasons for drafting the ex-
    cept clause, there is no sound basis for giving that clause a broader
    reading than its language can bear, especially in light of the dramatic
    change such an interpretation would work in the 1933 Act’s jurisdic-
    tional framework. Pp. 15–18.
        2. SLUSA does not permit defendants to remove class actions alleg-
    ing only 1933 Act claims from state to federal court. The Govern-
    ment argues that §77p(c) allows defendants to remove 1933 Act class
    actions to federal court as long as they allege the kinds of misconduct
    listed in §77p(b). But most naturally read, §77p(c) refutes, not sup-
    ports, the Government’s view. Section 77p(c) allows for removal of
    “[a]ny covered class action brought in any State court involving a
    covered security, as set forth in subsection (b).” The covered class ac-
                     Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)                      5

                                Syllabus

  tions “set forth” in §77p(b) are state-law class actions alleging securi-
  ties misconduct. Federal-law suits are not “class action[s] . . . as set
  forth in subsection (b).” Thus, they remain subject to the 1933 Act’s
  removal ban. This Court has held as much, concluding that §§77p(b)
  and 77p(c) apply to the exact same universe of class actions. Kircher,
  547 U. S., at 643–644. The “straightforward reading” of those two
  provisions is that removal under §77p(c) is “limited to those [actions]
  precluded by the terms of subsection (b).” Id., at 643. Pp. 18–24.

   ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEAL OF 

        CALIFORNIA, FIRST APPELLATE DISTRICT

                                [March 20, 2018]

   JUSTICE KAGAN delivered the opinion of the Court.
   This case presents two questions about the Securities
Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 (SLUSA), 112
Stat. 3227. First, did SLUSA strip state courts of jurisdic-
tion over class actions alleging violations of only the Secu-
rities Act of 1933 (1933 Act), 48 Stat. 74, as amended, 15
U. S. C. §77a et seq.? And second, even if not, did SLUSA
empower defendants to remove such actions from state to
federal court? We answer both questions no.
                              I

                             A

  In the wake of the 1929 stock market crash, Congress
enacted two laws, in successive years, to promote honest
practices in the securities markets. The 1933 Act required
companies offering securities to the public to make “full
and fair disclosure” of relevant information. Pinter v.
Dahl, 486 U. S. 622, 646 (1988). And to aid enforcement of
those obligations, the statute created private rights of
action. Congress authorized both federal and state courts
to exercise jurisdiction over those private suits. See
§22(a), 48 Stat. 86 (“The district courts of the United
2        CYAN, INC. v. BEAVER COUNTY EMPLOYEES
                    RETIREMENT FUND                          

                      Opinion of the Court 


States . . . shall have jurisdiction[,] concurrent with State
and Territorial courts, of all suits in equity and actions at
law brought to enforce any liability or duty created by this
title”). More unusually, Congress also barred the removal
of such actions from state to federal court. Id., at 87 (“No
case arising under this title and brought in any State
court of competent jurisdiction shall be removed to any
court of the United States”). So if a plaintiff chose to bring
a 1933 Act suit in state court, the defendant could not
change the forum.
   Congress’s next foray, the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (1934 Act), operated differently. See 48 Stat. 881, as
amended, 15 U. S. C. §78a et seq. That statute regulated
not the original issuance of securities but instead all their
subsequent trading, most commonly on national stock
exchanges. See Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores,
421 U. S. 723, 752 (1975). The 1934 Act, this Court held,
could also be enforced through private rights of action.
See id., at 730, and n. 4. But Congress determined that all
those suits should fall within the “exclusive jurisdiction” of
the federal courts. §27, 48 Stat. 902–903. So a plaintiff
could never go to state court to litigate a 1934 Act claim.
   In 1995, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
(Reform Act), 109 Stat. 737, amended both the 1933 and
the 1934 statutes in mostly identical ways. Congress
passed the Reform Act principally to stem “perceived
abuses of the class-action vehicle in litigation involving
nationally traded securities.” Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fen-
ner & Smith Inc. v. Dabit, 547 U. S. 71, 81 (2006). Some of
the Reform Act’s provisions made substantive changes to
the 1933 and 1934 laws, and applied even when a 1933
Act suit was brought in state court. For instance, the
statute created a “safe harbor” from federal liability for
certain “forward-looking statements” made by company
officials. 15 U. S. C. §77z–2 (1933 Act); §78u–5 (1934 Act).
Other Reform Act provisions modified the procedures used
                 Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)            3

                     Opinion of the Court

in litigating securities actions, and applied only when such
a suit was brought in federal court. To take one example,
the statute required a lead plaintiff in any class action
brought under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to file
a sworn certification stating, among other things, that he
had not purchased the relevant security “at the direction
of plaintiff ’s counsel.”     §77z–1(a)(2)(A)(ii) (1933 Act);
§78u–4(a)(2)(A)(ii) (1934 Act).
  But the Reform Act fell prey to the law of “unintended
consequence[s].” Dabit, 547 U. S., at 82. As this Court
previously described the problem: “Rather than face the
obstacles set in their path by the Reform Act, plaintiffs
and their representatives began bringing class actions
under state law.” Ibid. That “phenomenon was a novel
one”—and an unwelcome one as well. Ibid. To prevent
plaintiffs from circumventing the Reform Act, Congress
again undertook to modify both securities laws.
  The result was SLUSA, whose amendments to the 1933
Act are at issue in this case. Those amendments include,
as relevant here, two operative provisions, two associated
definitions, and two “conforming amendments” to the 1933
law’s jurisdictional section. 112 Stat. 3230. (SLUSA’s
amendments to the 1934 Act include essentially the same
operative provisions and definitions. See Dabit, 547 U. S.,
at 82, n. 6. But Congress decided that the 1934 law’s
exclusive jurisdiction provision needed no conforming
amendments.) The added material—now found in §§77p
and 77v(a) and set out in full in this opinion’s appendix—
goes as follows.
  First, §77p(b) altogether prohibits certain securities
class actions based on state law. That provision—which
we sometimes (and somewhat prosaically) refer to as the
state-law class-action bar—reads:
      “No covered class action based upon the statutory or
    common law of any State . . . may be maintained in
4        CYAN, INC. v. BEAVER COUNTY EMPLOYEES
                    RETIREMENT FUND                         

                      Opinion of the Court 


    any State or Federal court by any private party
    alleging—
    “(1) an untrue statement or omission of a material fact
    in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered
    security; or
    “(2) that the defendant used or employed any manipu-
    lative or deceptive device or contrivance in connection
    with the purchase or sale of a covered security.”
According to SLUSA’s definitions, the term “covered class
action” means a class action in which “damages are sought
on behalf of more than 50 persons.” §77p(f)(2). And the
term “covered security” refers to a security listed on a
national stock exchange.       §77p(f)(3) (cross-referencing
§77r(b)). So taken all in all, §77p(b) completely disallows
(in both state and federal courts) sizable class actions that
are founded on state law and allege dishonest practices
respecting a nationally traded security’s purchase or sale.
   Next, §77p(c) provides for the removal of certain class
actions to federal court, as well as for their subsequent
disposition:
      “Any covered class action brought in any State court
    involving a covered security, as set forth in subsection
    (b) of this section, shall be removable to the Federal
    district court for the district in which the action is
    pending, and shall be subject to subsection (b) of this
    section.”
The first chunk of that provision identifies the removable
cases, partly by way of a cross-reference (“as set forth in
subsection (b)”) to the just-described class-action bar. The
final clause of the provision (“and shall be subject to sub-

                     Opinion of the Court

§77p(c) “avails a defendant of a federal forum in contem-
plation not of further litigation over the merits of a claim
brought in state court, but of termination of the proceed-
ings altogether.” Id., at 645, n. 12. The point of providing
that option, everyone here agrees, was to ensure the dis-
missal of a prohibited state-law class action even when a
state court “would not adequately enforce” §77p(b)’s bar.
Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 3; see Brief for
Petitioners 7; Brief for Respondents 20.
  Finally, the 1933 Act’s jurisdictional provision, codified
at §77v(a), now includes two new phrases framed as ex-
emptions—SLUSA’s self-described “conforming amend-
ments.” 112 Stat. 3230; see supra, at 3. The less signifi-
cant of the pair, for our purposes, reflects the allowance
for removing certain class actions described above.
Against the backdrop of the 1933 Act’s general removal
bar, see supra, at 2, that added (italicized) material reads:
    “Except as provided in section 77p(c) of this title, no
    case arising under this subchapter and brought in any
    State court of competent jurisdiction shall be removed
    to any court of the United States.”
The more important of the conforming amendments in this
case expresses a caveat to the general rule, see supra, at
1–2, that state and federal courts have concurrent juris-
diction over all claims to enforce the 1933 Act. As amended
(again, with the new material in italics), the relevant
sentence now reads:
    “The district courts of the United States . . . shall have
    jurisdiction[,] concurrent with State and Territorial
    courts, except as provided in section 77p of this title
    with respect to covered class actions, of all suits in eq-
    uity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability
    or duty created by this subchapter.”
Throughout this opinion, we refer to the italicized words

just above as the “except clause.” Its meaning is at the
heart of the parties’ dispute in this Court.
                              B
   The petitioners in this case are Cyan, a telecommunica-
tions company, and its officers and directors (together,
Cyan). The respondents are three pension funds and an
individual (together, Investors) who purchased shares of
Cyan stock in an initial public offering. After the stock
declined in value, the Investors brought a damages class
action against Cyan in California Superior Court. Their
complaint alleges that Cyan’s offering documents con-
tained material misstatements, in violation of the 1933
Act. It does not assert any claims based on state law.
   Cyan moved to dismiss the Investors’ suit for lack of
subject matter jurisdiction. It argued that what we have
termed SLUSA’s “except clause”—i.e., the amendment
made to §77v(a)’s concurrent-jurisdiction grant—stripped
state courts of power to adjudicate 1933 Act claims in
“covered class actions.” The Investors did not dispute that
their suit qualifies as such an action under SLUSA’s
definition, see §77p(f )(2). But they maintained that
SLUSA left intact state courts’ jurisdiction over all suits—
including “covered class actions”—alleging only 1933 Act
claims. The California Superior Court agreed with the
Investors and denied Cyan’s motion to dismiss. See App.
to Pet. for Cert. 6a. The state appellate courts then denied
review of that ruling. See id., at 15a–16a.
   We granted Cyan’s petition for certiorari, 581 U. S. ___
(2017), to resolve a split among state and federal courts
about whether SLUSA deprived state courts of jurisdiction
over “covered class actions” asserting only 1933 Act
claims.1

                         Opinion of the Court

  In opposing Cyan’s jurisdictional position here, the
Federal Government as amicus curiae raised another
question: whether SLUSA enabled defendants to remove
1933 Act class actions from state to federal court for adju-
dication. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae
23–31. That question is not directly presented because
Cyan never attempted to remove the Investors’ suit. But
the removal issue is related to the parties’ jurisdictional
arguments, and both Cyan and the Investors addressed it
in briefing and argument. See Brief for Petitioners 39–40;
Brief for Respondents 31–35; Tr. of Arg. 31, 53–56, 74–76,
80. Accordingly, we consider as well the scope of §77p(c)’s
removal authorization.
                            II
  By its terms, §77v(a)’s “except clause” does nothing to
deprive state courts of their jurisdiction to decide class
actions brought under the 1933 Act. And Cyan’s various
appeals to SLUSA’s purposes and legislative history fail to
overcome the clear statutory language. The statute says
what it says—or perhaps better put here, does not say
what it does not say. State-court jurisdiction over 1933
Act claims thus continues undisturbed.2

courts have jurisdiction over covered class actions alleging only 1933
Act claims), with, e.g., Knox v. Agria Corp., 613 F. Supp. 2d 419, 425

actions).
   2 This Court has often applied a “presumption in favor of concurrent

state court jurisdiction” when interpreting federal statutes. Mims v.

Tafflin v. Levitt, 493 U. S. 455, 458–459 (1990)). Cyan argues that the
presumption should not apply here because SLUSA included explicit
“language addressing state-court jurisdiction” and “the only question is
[its] scope.” Reply Brief 22. We need not address that contention
because SLUSA’s text precludes Cyan’s position without aid from any
presumption.

                    RETIREMENT FUND                          

                      Opinion of the Court 


                                A
  SLUSA’s text, read most straightforwardly, leaves in
place state courts’ jurisdiction over 1933 Act claims, in-
cluding when brought in class actions. Recall that the
background rule of §77v(a)—in place since the 1933 Act’s
passage—gives state courts concurrent jurisdiction over
all suits “brought to enforce any liability or duty created
by” that statute. See supra, at 1–2. The except clause—
once again, “except as provided in section 77p of this title
with respect to covered class actions”—is drafted as a
limitation on that rule: It ensures that in any case in
which §77v(a) and §77p come into conflict, §77p will con-
trol. The critical question for this case is therefore whether
§77p limits state-court jurisdiction over class actions
brought under the 1933 Act. It does not. As earlier de-
scribed, §77p bars certain securities class actions based on
state law. See §77p(b); supra, at 3–4. And as a corollary of
that prohibition, it authorizes removal of those suits so
that a federal court can dismiss them. See §77p(c); supra,
at 4–5. But the section says nothing, and so does nothing,
to deprive state courts of jurisdiction over class actions
based on federal law. That means the background rule of
§77v(a)—under which a state court may hear the Inves-
tors’ 1933 Act suit—continues to govern.
   Cyan offers an alternative reading, in which one of
SLUSA’s definitional provisions works to alter state-court
jurisdiction. According to Cyan, the except clause’s refer-
ence to “covered class actions” points the reader to, and
only to, §77p(f )(2)’s definition of that term. See Brief for
Petitioners 16. And that definition states that a “covered
class action” is a suit seeking damages on behalf of more
than 50 persons—without mentioning anything about
whether the suit is based on state or federal law. Cyan
thus concludes that the except clause exempts all sizable
class actions—including the Investors’ suit—from
                      Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)                     9

                          Opinion of the Court

§77v(a)’s conferral of jurisdiction on state courts.
   But that view cannot be squared with the except
clause’s wording for two independent reasons. To start
with, the except clause points to “section 77p” as a whole—
not to paragraph 77p(f )(2). Cyan wants to cherry pick
from the material covered by the statutory cross-reference.
But if Congress had intended to refer to the definition in
§77p(f )(2) alone, it presumably would have done so—just
by adding a letter, a number, and a few parentheticals. As
this Court recently explained, “Congress often drafts
statutes with hierarchical schemes—section, subsection,
paragraph, and on down the line.” NLRB v. SW General,
Inc., 580 U. S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 9). And “[w]hen
Congress want[s] to refer only to a particular subsection or
paragraph, it sa[ys] so.” Ibid. It said no such thing in the
except clause.
   In any event, the definitional paragraph on which Cyan
relies cannot be read to “provide[ ]” an “except[ion]” to the
rule of concurrent jurisdiction, in the way SLUSA’s except
clause requires. A definition does not provide an excep-
tion, but instead gives meaning to a term—and Congress
well knows the difference between those two functions.
Thousands of statutory provisions use the phrase “except
as provided in . . .” followed by a cross-reference in order to
indicate that one rule should prevail over another in any
circumstance in which the two conflict; we count more
than 30 such constructions in the 1933 and 1934 Acts
alone.3    Not one of those 30-plus provisions cross-

general rule that “the rights and remedies provided” under the statute

                         Opinion of the Court 


references a definition; nor has Cyan pointed to a single
such example from the whole rest of the U. S. Code. And
the Congress enacting SLUSA had no reason to attempt
that peculiar maneuver for the first time. If Congress had
wanted to deprive state courts of jurisdiction over 1933
Act class actions, it had an easy way to do so: just insert
into §77p an exclusive federal jurisdiction provision (like
the 1934 Act’s) for such suits. That rule, when combined
with the except clause, would have done the trick because
it would have “provided” an “except[ion]” to §77v(a)’s grant
of concurrent jurisdiction; by contrast, a mere definition of
“covered class action” (as a damages suit on behalf of 50-
plus people) does not so provide.
   SLUSA’s other conforming amendment illustrates the
two ways in which Cyan’s construction of the except clause
departs from its language. Recall that §77v(a) includes a
general bar on removal. See supra, at 2. And recall that
SLUSA appended to that prohibition the phrase “[e]xcept
as provided in section 77p(c)” to reflect the statute’s new
permission to remove certain class actions. See supra,
at 5. In that “except as provided” phrase—just four sen-
tences down from the except clause central to this case—
Congress pinpointed a subsection of §77p, rather than
citing the entire section for only one of its parts. Still
more, that cross-referenced subsection contains an opera-
tive provision that could limit a rule, rather than a mere
definition of a statutory term. In short, Congress wrote
the removal bar’s except clause in just the way a reader of
legislation would expect—and not in the wholly irregular
way Cyan proposes for the except clause at issue here.
Especially given the two provisions’ “interrelationship and
close proximity,” Commissioner v. Lundy, 516 U. S. 235,
250 (1996), the one conforming amendment highlights how
far Cyan seeks to stretch the text of the other.

                      Opinion of the Court

   Cyan’s interpretation also fits poorly with the remainder
of the statutory scheme. Because Cyan treats the broad
definition of “covered class action” as altering §77v(a)’s
jurisdictional grant, its construction would prevent state
courts from deciding any 1933 Act class suits seeking
damages for more than 50 plaintiffs. That would include
suits not involving a “covered security”—i.e., a security
traded on a national stock exchange. §77p(f )(3); Brief for
Petitioners 29 (conceding that point). But this Court has
emphasized that SLUSA’s operative provisions (including
its state-law class-action bar, see §77p(b)) apply to only
“transactions in covered securities”: The statute “ex-
presses no concern” with “transactions in uncovered securi-
ties”—precisely because they are not traded on national
markets. Chadbourne & Parke LLP v. Troice, 571 U. S.
377, ___ (2014) (slip. op., at 9); see Brief for United States
as Amicus Curiae 16–17 (SLUSA does not regard suits
involving uncovered securities as “a matter of distinct
federal concern”). Those securities, the Court explained,
are “primarily of state concern,” and SLUSA “maintains
state legal authority” to address them. Chadbourne, 571
U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13). Except that under Cyan’s
view, SLUSA would not. Instead, the law would strip
state courts of jurisdiction over suits about securities
raising no particular national interest. That result is out
of line with SLUSA’s overall scope.
   And finally, Cyan’s take on the except clause reads too
much into a mere “conforming amendment.” 112 Stat.
3230. The change Cyan claims that clause made to state-
court jurisdiction is the very opposite of a minor tweak.
When Congress passed SLUSA, state courts had for 65
years adjudicated all manner of 1933 Act cases, including
class actions. Indeed, defendants could not even remove
those cases to federal court, as schemes of concurrent
jurisdiction almost always allow. See supra, at 2. State
courts thus had as much or more power over the 1933

                      Opinion of the Court 


Act’s enforcement as over any federal statute’s. To think
Cyan right, we would have to believe that Congress up-
ended that entrenched practice not by any direct means,
but instead by way of a conforming amendment to §77v(a)
(linked, in its view, with only a definition). But Congress
does not make “radical—but entirely implicit—change[s]”
through “technical and conforming amendments.” Direc-
tor of Revenue of Mo. v. CoBank ACB, 531 U. S. 316, 324
(2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). Or to use the
more general (and snappier) formulation of that rule,
relevant to all “ancillary provisions,” Congress does not
“hide elephants in mouseholes.” Whitman v. American
Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 468 (2001). That is
yet one more reason to reject Cyan’s view of SLUSA’s text.
                             B
  Faced with such recalcitrant statutory language, Cyan
stakes much of its case on legislative purpose and history.
See Brief for Petitioners 20–33, 36–37; Reply Brief 7–11,
17–21. Its claims come in two forms—one relating to the
goals of SLUSA as a whole and the other relating to the
aims of the except clause. Even assuming clear text can
ever give way to purpose, Cyan would need some monster
arguments on this score to create doubts about SLUSA’s
meaning. The points Cyan raises come nowhere close to
that level.
                              1
  According to Cyan’s broad purposive argument, Con-
gress could not “make good on the promise of the Reform
Act”—which was its principal intention in enacting
SLUSA—without divesting state courts of jurisdiction over
all sizable 1933 Act class actions. Brief for Petitioners 20.
Remember that the Reform Act contained a number of
procedural measures (for example, a sworn-certification
requirement for lead plaintiffs, see §77z–1(a)(2)(A)) that
                  Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)           13

                      Opinion of the Court

apply only in federal court. See supra, at 2–3. Plaintiffs
bringing 1933 Act class actions could avoid those provi-
sions simply by filing in state court; after all, those suits
were not even removable by defendants. “So,” Cyan
claims, “Congress enacted SLUSA to finish the job”—by
shutting down the state forum and shifting all 1933 Act
class actions to the federal one. Brief for Petitioners 21.
In support of that view, Cyan cites several statements in
SLUSA’s legislative reports—in particular, that SLUSA’s
purpose was “to prevent plaintiffs from seeking to evade
the protections that Federal law provides against abusive
litigation by filing suit in State, rather than in Federal,
court.” H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 105–803, p. 13 (1998); see
H. R. Rep. No. 105–640, pp. 8–9 (1998); S. Rep. No. 105–
182, p. 3 (1998).
   But to begin with, Cyan ignores a different way in which
SLUSA “serve[d] the [Reform Act’s] objectives,” Brief for
Petitioners 11—which our view of the statute fully effects.
Recall that the Reform Act also included substantive
sections protecting defendants (like a safe harbor for
forward-looking statements) in suits brought under the
federal securities laws. See §77z–2; supra, at 2. Plaintiffs
could—and did—avoid those provisions by bringing their
complaints of securities misconduct under state law in-
stead. See supra, at 3. Hence emerged SLUSA’s bar on
state-law class actions (and its removal provision to en-
sure their dismissal)—which guaranteed that the Reform
Act’s heightened substantive standards would govern all
future securities class litigation. SLUSA itself highlights
that aim: Its preamble states that the statute is designed
“to limit the conduct of securities class actions under State
law, and for other purposes.” 112 Stat. 3227. So too, this
Court has underscored, over and over, SLUSA’s “purpose
to preclude certain vexing state-law class actions.”
Kircher, 547 U. S., at 645, n. 12; see Dabit, 547 U. S., at 82
(SLUSA stopped plaintiffs from “bringing class actions

under state law”); Amgen Inc. v. Connecticut Retirement
Plans and Trust Funds, 568 U. S. 455, 476 (2013) (SLUSA
“curtailed plaintiffs’ ability to evade the [Reform Act] by
bringing class-action suits under state rather than federal
law”). That object—which SLUSA’s text actually re-
flects—does not depend on stripping state courts of juris-
diction over 1933 Act class suits, as Cyan proposes. For
wherever those suits go forward, the Reform Act’s sub-
stantive protections necessarily apply.
   Still more, SLUSA ensured that federal courts would
play the principal role in adjudicating securities class
actions by means of its revisions to the 1934 Act. As
explained earlier, SLUSA amended that statute in the
same main way it did the 1933 Act—by adding a state-law
class-action bar. See §78bb(f )(1); supra, at 3. But there,
the change had a double effect: Because federal courts
have exclusive jurisdiction over 1934 Act claims, forcing
plaintiffs to bring class actions under the 1934 statute
instead of state law also forced them to file in federal
court. That meant the bulk of securities class actions
would proceed in federal court—because the 1934 Act
regulates all trading of securities whereas the 1933 Act
addresses only securities offerings.        See Blue Chip
Stamps, 421 U. S., at 752 (characterizing the 1933 Act as
“a far narrower statute”). So even without Cyan’s con-
trived reading of the except clause, SLUSA largely accom-
plished the purpose articulated in its Conference Report:
moving securities class actions to federal court.
   To be sure, “largely” does not mean “entirely”—but then
again, we do not generally expect statutes to fulfill 100%
of all of their goals. See, e.g., Freeman v. Quicken Loans,
Inc., 566 U. S. 624, 637 (2012) (“No legislation pursues its
purposes at all costs” (internal quotation marks and alter-
ations omitted)). Under our reading of SLUSA, all covered
securities class actions must proceed under federal law;
most (i.e., those alleging 1934 Act claims) must proceed in

                      Opinion of the Court

federal court; some (i.e., those alleging 1933 Act claims)
may proceed in state court. We do not know why Congress
declined to require as well that 1933 Act class actions be
brought in federal court; perhaps it was because of the
long and unusually pronounced tradition of according
authority to state courts over 1933 Act litigation. See
supra, at 11–12. But in any event, we will not revise that
legislative choice, by reading a conforming amendment
and a definition in a most improbable way, in an effort to
make the world of securities litigation more consistent or
pure. This Court has long rejected the notion that “what-
ever furthers the statute’s primary objective must be the
law.” Rodriguez v. United States, 480 U. S. 522, 526
(1987) (per curiam). Even if Congress could or should
have done more, still it “wrote the statute it wrote—
meaning, a statute going so far and no further.” Michigan
v. Bay Mills Indian Community, 572 U. S. ___, ___ (2014)
(slip op., at 11) (internal quotation marks omitted).
                                2
   Yet Cyan has a final argument—that the except clause
would serve no purpose at all unless it works as Cyan
says. See Brief for Petitioners 32–33; Reply Brief 8–11.
Here, Cyan relies on an indubitable puzzle. Section
77v(a), as amended by SLUSA, gives state courts jurisdic-
tion over 1933 Act suits “except as provided in §77p.” But
§77p provides a bar on only certain state-law suits. So,
Cyan contends, unless we take up its invitation to look to
§77p(f )(2)’s definition of “covered class action,” the except
clause excepts “exactly nothing.” Reply Brief 8. (To use
an example of our own, it would be as if a parent told her
child “you may have fruit after dinner, except for lolli-
pops.”) What on earth, Cyan asks, would be the point of
such a provision?
   The Investors answer that question with a theory about
why Congress enacted the except clause. In their view,
16       CYAN, INC. v. BEAVER COUNTY EMPLOYEES 

                    RETIREMENT FUND                         

                      Opinion of the Court 


the clause was meant to deal with “mixed” securities class
actions—containing both claims brought under the 1933
Act and claims arising under state law. See Brief for
Respondents 12–13. If not for the except clause, the In-
vestors posit, state courts would have been uncertain
about how to handle those suits. Section 77p clearly
instructs courts not to adjudicate the state-law claims; but
(the Investors continue) §77v(a) gives state courts jurisdic-
tion over entire “actions” brought to enforce the 1933 Act,
even if they include additional state-law claims. What,
then, to do? According to the Investors, the except clause’s
purpose was to resolve that statutory conflict by making
clear that §77p trumps §77v(a)—in other words, that a
state court may not entertain state-law claims precluded
by §77p(b) even when they are conjoined with 1933 Act
claims falling within §77v(a)’s grant of jurisdiction.
   Truth be told, we are not sure whether Congress had
that issue in mind. On the one hand (and contrary to
what the Investors say), we doubt that the except clause
was really necessary to address mixed class actions. Even
without that clause, a competent state court faced with
such a suit would understand that §77p requires dismissal
of the state-law claims—and that §77v(a)’s jurisdictional
grant over 1933 Act suits is not to the contrary. But on
the other hand (and now supporting the Investors’ princi-
pal point), Congress may have thought that class-action
lawyers would still try to circumvent SLUSA by tacking a
1933 Act claim onto a forbidden state-law class action, on
the off chance of finding an error-prone judge. (After all,
the worst that could happen was that the court would
throw out the state-law claims, leaving the plaintiff with a
permissible 1933 Act suit.) To prevent such gamesman-
ship—to make clear beyond peradventure that courts
could not entertain the state-law half of mixed class ac-

   But even if Congress never specifically considered mixed

                           Opinion of the Court

suits, it could well have added the except clause in a more
general excess of caution—to safeguard §77p’s class-action
bar come whatever might. This Court has encountered
many examples of Congress legislating in that hyper-
vigilant way, to “remov[e] any doubt” as to things not
particularly doubtful in the first instance. Marx v. Gen-
eral Revenue Corp., 568 U. S. 371, 383–384 (2013) (citing
Ali v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, 552 U. S. 214, 226 (2008);
Fort Stewart Schools v. FLRA, 495 U. S. 641, 646 (1990)).
(The idea, to return to our prior example, is to make sure
that even if the child thinks orange lollipops count as fruit,
she will not act on that view.) And if ever Congress had
reason to legislate in that fashion, it was in SLUSA—
whose very impetus lay in the success of class-action
attorneys in “bypass[ing] . . . the Reform Act.” Kircher,
547 U. S., at 636. Heedful of that history of machinations,
Congress may have determined to eliminate any risk—
even if unlikely or at the time unknown—that a pre-
existing grant of power to state courts could be used to
obstruct SLUSA’s new limitation on what they could
decide. And so (this alternative explanation goes) Con-
gress enacted the except clause—which, in insisting that
the limitation prevailed, would function as the ultimate
(though with any luck, unneeded) fail-safe device.4
——————
  4 In line with this precautionary function, the except clause could do

some work to protect §77p’s state-law class-action bar in a set of suits
beyond mixed cases. As this Court recently noted, some state-law
securities claims “rise[ ] or fall[ ] on the plaintiff ’s ability to prove the
violation” of a federal securities statute. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner
& Smith Inc. v. Manning, 578 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 7)
(addressing the 1934 Act). In such cases, we held, the state-law claims
are “brought to enforce” a liability created by the federal statute, and
thus fall within that law’s jurisdictional provision. See id., at ___ (slip
op., at 8). In the absence of the except clause, then, class-action law-
yers might well have argued that such state-law claims could be adju-
dicated under §77v(a) notwithstanding §77p’s bar. Once again, we
think most courts would have rejected that claim and decided that §77p

                       Opinion of the Court 


   But the most important response to this purposive
argument echoes what we have said before about the
weaknesses of Cyan’s own construction of the except
clause. In the end, the uncertainty surrounding Con-
gress’s reasons for drafting that clause does not matter.
Nor does the possibility that the risk Congress addressed
(whether specific or inchoate) did not exist. Because irre-
spective of those points, we have no sound basis for giving
the except clause a broader reading than its language can
bear. And that is especially true in light of the dramatic
change such an interpretation would work in the 1933
Act’s jurisdictional framework. Whatever questions re-
main as to the except clause’s precise purpose—and we do
not gainsay there are some—they do not give us permis-
sion to devise a statute (and at that, a transformative one)
of our own.
                             III
   Our last task is to address the Federal Government’s
proposed halfway-house position. The Government rejects
Cyan’s view that SLUSA stripped state courts of jurisdic-
tion over 1933 Act class actions, for roughly the same
reasons we have given. See Brief for United States as
Amicus Curiae 11–23. But like Cyan, the Government
believes that “Congress would not have been content to
leave” such suits “stuck in state court,” where the Reform
Act’s procedural protections do not apply. Id., at 15 (in-
ternal quotation marks omitted). So the Government
offers a reading of SLUSA—in particular, of §77p(c)—that
would allow defendants to remove 1933 Act class actions
to federal court, as long as they allege the kinds of mis-
conduct listed in §77p(b) (e.g., false statements or decep-
tive devices in connection with a covered security’s pur-

controls—but the except clause eliminates any chance of a contrary 

holding.

chase or sale). See id., at 24–25.
  But most naturally read, §77p(c)—SLUSA’s exception to
the 1933 Act’s general bar on removal—refutes, not sup-
ports, the Government’s view. Once again, see supra, at 4,
§77p(c) reads as follows:
    “Any covered class action brought in any State court
    involving a covered security, as set forth in subsection
    (b) of this section, shall be removable to the Federal
    district court for the district in which the action is
    pending, and shall be subject to subsection (b) of this
    section.”
In other words, the covered class actions described in
§77p(b) can be removed to federal court (and, once there,
shall be subject to dismissal because precluded, see supra,
at 5). And which are the covered class actions described in
§77p(b)? By this point, no one should have to be reminded:
They are state-law class actions alleging securities mis-
conduct. See §77p(b) (prohibiting “class action[s] based
upon the statutory or common law of any State”). So those
state-law suits are removable. But conversely, federal-law
suits like this one—alleging only 1933 Act claims—are not
“class action[s] . . . as set forth in subsection (b).” So they
remain subject to the 1933 Act’s removal ban.
   In fact, this Court already held as much, by concluding
in Kircher that §§77p(b) and 77p(c) apply to the exact
same universe of class actions. See 547 U. S., at 643–644.
Kircher involved a securities suit that was unaffected by
§77p(b)’s class-action bar—there, not because it was based
on federal law but because it involved a form of conduct
falling outside that subsection. The Court of Appeals
decided that the suit could be removed under §77p(c) even
though it was not precluded by §77p(b), thinking (as we
later put it) that the removal issue and “the preclusion
issue [were] distinct.” Id., at 638. We flatly rejected that
understanding of the relationship between §77p(b) and
20         CYAN, INC. v. BEAVER COUNTY EMPLOYEES

                        Opinion of the Court 


§77p(c). The “straightforward reading” of those two provi-
sions, we explained, is that removal is “limited to those
[actions] precluded by the terms of subsection (b).” Id., at
643. And if that were not clear enough, we said it again:
Removal under §77p(c) is “restricted to precluded actions
defined by subsection (b).” Id., at 643–644. And just to
pound the point home, we said it yet a third time: “A
covered [class] action is removable if it is precluded.” Id.,
at 646. Kircher thus forecloses the Government’s argu-
ment. Section 77p(b) does not preclude federal-law class
actions. So under our decision, §77p(c) does not authorize
their removal.5
  The Government responds with a novel way of under-
standing §77p(c), which it thinks would allow us to disre-
gard Kircher when a class action like this one is based on
federal law. In the Government’s view, first presented at
oral argument, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 32–33, the words “as
set forth in subsection (b)” do not modify the entire preced-
ing phrase (basically, any large class action involving a
covered security). Instead, the Government claims, those
words modify only the shorter phrase “involving a covered
security.” To support that view, the Government invokes
the “rule of the last antecedent”—under which “the limit-
ing clause is most naturally applied to the thing that
comes immediately before it.” Id., at 36. The Government
——————
  5 In light of SLUSA’s text and Kircher’s holding, it should come as no

surprise that all seven Courts of Appeals to have considered the matter
have concluded that §77p(c) allows removal of only class actions falling
within §77p(b)’s prohibition. See Campbell v. American Int’l Group,
Inc., 760 F. 3d 62, 64 (CADC 2014); Hidalgo-Velez v. San Juan Asset
Management, 758 F. 3d 98, 103 (CA1 2014); Appert v. Morgan Stanley

                     Opinion of the Court

then presents a theory of how subsection (b) “set[s] forth”
the “involv[ement]” of a covered security. “[T]o figure out
what that means,” the Government contends, “you look at
[§77p](b)(1) and (b)(2), which talk about certain types of
misconduct”—for example, false statements or deceptive
devices in connection with a covered security’s sale. Id., at
33–34. As long as conduct of that kind is implicated in a
suit, the Government concludes, it can be removed—even
if it is based on federal law and thus does not fall within
§77p(b) as a whole. That view is consistent with Kircher’s
result because the action there did not involve the conduct
described in §§77p(b)(1) and (2). And as to Kircher’s ra-
tionale . . . well, we should feel free to ignore it.
   But even putting aside respect for precedent, that ar-
gument is in many ways flawed. To start with, the Gov-
ernment provides no good reason to think that “as set
forth in subsection (b)” modifies only the phrase “involving
a covered security.” As stated above, the most natural
way to view the modifier is as applying to the entire pre-
ceding clause—again, “[a]ny covered class action brought
in any State court involving a covered security.” See
supra, at 19. That is so because that clause hangs together
as a unified whole, referring to a single thing (a type of
class action). Consider the following, grammatically iden-
tical construction: “The woman dressed to the nines carry-
ing an umbrella, as shown in the picture . . .” Would
anyone think that “as shown in the picture” referred to
anything less than the well-attired and rain-ready woman?
No. And so too here, the modifier goes back to the begin-
ning of the preceding clause. The rule of the last anteced-
ent is not to the contrary. We have applied that rule when
the alternative reading would “stretch[ ] the modifier too
far” by asking it to qualify a remote or otherwise discon-
nected phrase. Jama v. Immigration and Customs En-
forcement, 543 U. S. 335, 342 (2005); Lockhart v. United
States, 577 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 4) (using the

                        Opinion of the Court 


rule “where it takes more than a little mental energy to
process” a statute’s component parts, “making it a heavy
lift to carry the modifier across them all”).6 By contrast,
we have not applied the rule when the modifier directly
follows a concise and “integrated” clause. Jama, 543 U. S.,
at 344, n. 4. As it does here.
   But let us assume that the rule of the last antecedent
governs: The Government then misapplies it by attaching
the modifier to something more than the last thing before
it. The rule, correctly used, would insist that “as set forth
in subsection (b)” modifies only “a covered security”—
because that is the closest “noun or noun phrase” that the
modifier could reasonably reference. A. Scalia & B. Gar-
ner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 144
(2012) (quoting R. Burchfield, Fowler’s Modern English
Usage (3d ed. 1996)). But that standard way of applying
the rule would not aid the Government’s construction, so it
goes back yet another word: It attaches “as set forth in
subsection (b)” to the longer phrase—and a verb phrase at
that—“involving a covered security.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 35.
That maneuver has no grammatical basis. (It is as if, in
the example offered above, someone claimed that “as
shown in the picture” modified not the woman, nor even
the umbrella, but instead the in-between verb phrase
“carrying an umbrella.”) The Government is choosing
where to start in the sentence (that is, which words to
——————
  6 The classic example comes from Barnhart v. Thomas, 540 U. S. 20
(2003). The statute at issue provided that a person is disabled if his
impairment is so severe that “he is not only unable to do his previous
work but cannot, considering his age, education, and work experience,
engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the
national economy.” Id., at 23 (quoting 42 U. S. C. §423(d)(1)(A)) (em-
phasis altered). Invoking the rule of the last antecedent, we concluded
that the italicized phrase “which exists in the national economy”
modifies only “substantial gainful work,” and not the more distant
“previous work.” See 540 U. S., at 26. Needless to say, that statutory
provision is a far cry from the one at issue here.

qualify) based only on what best serves its argument.
  But let us even assume that “as set forth in subsection
(b)” modifies “involving a covered security”: The language
would still fail to explain the Government’s position.
Remember that the Government reads the resulting
phrase (again, “involving a covered security, as set forth in
subsection (b)”) to point only to the forms of wrongful
conduct listed in §§77p(b)(1) and (2)—for example, false
statements or deceptive devices in securities sales. See
supra, at 21. The problem is that no one would describe
those misdeeds with that phrase. If Congress had meant
to refer only to that behavior, rather than to everything in
§77p(b), it would have done two things differently. First,
Congress would have written “as set forth in paragraphs
(b)(1) and (b)(2)” instead of “as set forth in subsection (b)”
as a whole. See supra, at 9 (explaining that when Con-
gress wants to refer only to a particular subsection or
paragraph, it says so). And second, Congress would have
written something like “involving allegations of miscon-
duct,” rather than “involving a covered security”—because
the latter phrase does not even passably describe
§§77(b)(1) and (2)’s catalog of vices. We will not read
“involving a covered security, as set forth in subsection
(b)” to mean “involving allegations of misconduct, as set
forth in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2)” when Congress did
not enact that formulation. See Lozano v. Montoya Alva-
rez, 572 U. S. 1, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 14) (“Given that the
drafters did not adopt that alternative, the natural impli-
cation is that they did not intend” to do so).
  And (finally, we promise) even if we could put out of
mind all these difficulties, the Government’s position runs
aground on §77p(c)’s last clause, which states that re-
moved class actions “shall be subject to subsection (b).”
That clause, properly understood, points toward dismissal
of a removed action. As we earlier explained, and the
Government concedes, Congress enacted §77p(c)’s removal
24       CYAN, INC. v. BEAVER COUNTY EMPLOYEES

provision out of “concern[ ] that state courts would not
adequately enforce” §77p(b)’s state-law class-action prohi-
bition. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 3; see
supra, at 5. The idea was to allow removal so that a fed-
eral court could act as a backstop and order a class action’s
dismissal—thereby “subject[ing]” it to §77p(b)’s bar.
Kircher specifically said as much: Section 77p(c) “avails a
defendant of a federal forum in contemplation not of fur-
ther litigation over the merits of a claim brought in state
court, but of termination of the proceedings altogether.”
547 U. S., at 645, n. 12; see supra, at 5. But of course, the
Government contemplates “further litigation”—not “ter-
mination”—of a removed 1933 Act class action. See Brief
for United States as Amicus Curiae 25. That decoupling of
§77p(c)’s linkage between removal and dismissal provides
the last reason to reject the Government’s argument.
   At bottom, the Government makes the same mistake as
Cyan: It distorts SLUSA’s text because it thinks Congress
simply must have wanted 1933 Act class actions to be
litigated in federal court. But this Court has no license
to “disregard clear language” based on an in-
tuition that “Congress must have intended something
broader.” Bay Mills, 572 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11)
(internal quotation marks omitted). SLUSA did quite a
bit to “make good on the promise of the Reform Act” (as
Cyan puts it). Brief for Petitioners 20; see supra, at 12–
13. If further steps are needed, they are up to Congress.
                            IV
  SLUSA did nothing to strip state courts of their
longstanding jurisdiction to adjudicate class actions alleg-
ing only 1933 Act violations. Neither did SLUSA author-
ize removing such suits from state to federal court. We
accordingly affirm the judgment below.

                                             It is so ordered.

                  GLEN CAMPBELL v. OHIO
  ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF 

          APPEALS OF OHIO, CUYAHOGA COUNTY

                No. 17–6232. Decided March 19, 2018

   The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
   Statement of JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR respecting the denial
of certiorari.
   Petitioner Glen Campbell challenges the constitutionality
of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §2953.08(D)(3) (West Supp. 2017),
which provides that sentences “imposed for aggravated
murder or murder” are “not subject to review.” I concur in
the denial of certiorari because Campbell failed ade-
quately to present his constitutional arguments to the state
courts. I nonetheless write separately because a statute
that shields from judicial scrutiny sentences of life with-
out the possibility of parole raises serious constitutional
concerns.
   In Ohio, after a defendant is found guilty of aggravated
murder, the State authorizes a range of penalties, includ­
ing life in prison with parole eligibility after 20, 25, or 30
years, or life imprisonment without the possibility of
parole. See §2929.03(A)(1). Under that scheme, Campbell
was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility
of parole after pleading guilty to aggravated murder. He
challenged his sentence on appeal, arguing in part that
the trial court failed to balance the aggravating and miti­
gating factors as required by §2929.12 of the Ohio statute.1

   1 In making sentencing determinations in felony cases, Ohio provides

that courts “shall be guided by the overriding purposes of felony sen­
tencing . . . to protect the public from future crime” and “punish the
offender,” §2929.11, and “shall consider” certain statutory aggravating
and mitigating factors, §2929.12.
2                   CAMPBELL v. OHIO

                  Statement of SOTOMAYOR, J.

The Court of Appeals of Ohio found this argument “unre­
viewable” under §2953.08(D)(3). App. to Pet. for Cert. A–
3. That provision, contained within the appellate review
section of the Ohio statute, provides: “A sentence imposed
for aggravated murder or murder pursuant to sections
2929.02 to 2929.06 of the Revised Code is not subject to
review under this section.” §2953.08(D)(3). The court
below relied on precedent from the Supreme Court of
Ohio, which has held that §2953.08(D)(3) is “unambigu­
ous” and “clearly means what it says: such a sentence
cannot be reviewed.” State v. Porterfield, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">106</span> <span class=""reporter"">Ohio St. 3d</span>
<span class=""page"">5</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 8, 2005-Ohio-3095, ¶17, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">829</span> <span class=""reporter"">N.E.2d</span> <span class=""page"">690</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 693.
   Trial judges making the determination whether a de­
fendant should be condemned to die in prison have a grave
responsibility, and the fact that Ohio has set up a scheme
under which those determinations “cannot be reviewed” is
deeply concerning. Life without parole “is the second most
severe penalty permitted by law.” Harmelin v. Michigan,
</pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""112646""><a href=""/opinion/112646/harmelin-v-michigan/""><span class=""volume"">501</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">957</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 1001 (1991) (KENNEDY, J., concurring in
part and concurring in judgment). In recent years this
Court has recognized that, although death is different,
“life without parole sentences share some characteristics
with death sentences that are shared by no other sentences.”
Graham v. Florida, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">560</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">48</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 69 (2010). “Impris-
oning an offender until he dies alters the remainder of his
life ‘by a forfeiture that is irrevocable.’ ” Miller v. Ala-
bama, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">567</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">460</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 474–475 (2012) (quoting Graham,
560 U. S., at 69). A life-without-parole sentence “means
denial of hope; it means that good behavior and character
improvement are immaterial; it means that whatever the
future might hold in store for the mind and spirit of the
convict, he will remain in prison for the rest of his days.”
Id., at 70 (internal quotation marks and bracket omitted).
   Because of the parallels between a sentence of death
and a sentence of life imprisonment without parole, the
Court has drawn on certain Eighth Amendment require­

ments developed in the capital sentencing context to
inform the life-without-parole sentencing context. For
instance, this Court imported the Eighth Amendment
requirement “demanding individualized sentencing when
imposing the death penalty” into the juvenile conviction
context, holding that “a similar rule should apply when a
juvenile confronts a sentence of life (and death) in prison.”
Miller, 567 U. S., at 475, 477. The Court also categorically
banned life-without-parole sentences for juvenile offenders
who did not commit homicide. See Graham, 560 U. S., at
82.
   The “correspondence” between capital punishment and
life sentences, Miller, 567 U. S., at 475, might similarly
require reconsideration of other sentencing practices in
the life-without-parole context. As relevant here, the
Eighth Amendment demands that capital sentencing
schemes ensure “measured, consistent application and
fairness to the accused,” Eddings v. Oklahoma, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""110641""><a href=""/opinion/110641/eddings-v-oklahoma/""><span class=""volume"">455</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span>
<span class=""page"">104</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 111 (1982), with the purpose of avoiding “the arbi­
trary or irrational imposition of the death penalty,” Parker

Court has repeatedly emphasized that meaningful appel­
late review of death sentences promotes reliability and
consistency.” Clemons v. Mississippi, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""112400""><a href=""/opinion/112400/clemons-v-mississippi/""><span class=""volume"">494</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">738</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 749
(1990); see also Parker, 498 U. S., at 321 (“We have em­
phasized repeatedly the crucial role of meaningful appel­
late review in ensuring that the death penalty is not im­
posed arbitrarily or irrationally”); Gregg v. Georgia, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""109532""><a href=""/opinion/109532/gregg-v-georgia/""><span class=""volume"">428</span>

and Stevens, JJ.) (noting that “the further safeguard of
meaningful appellate review is available to ensure that
death sentences are not imposed capriciously or in a freak­
ish manner”).
   In my view, this jurisprudence provides good reason to
question whether §2953.08(D)(3) really “means what it
says”: that a life-without-parole sentence, no matter how

arbitrarily or irrationally imposed, is shielded from mean­
ingful appellate review. Our Eighth Amendment juris­
prudence developed in the capital context calls into ques­
tion whether a defendant should be condemned to die in
prison without an appellate court having passed on
whether that determination properly took account of his
circumstances, was imposed as a result of bias,2 or was
otherwise imposed in a “freakish manner.” And our juris­
prudence questions whether it is permissible that Camp­
bell must now spend the rest of his days in prison without
ever having had the opportunity to challenge why his trial
judge chose the irrevocability of life without parole over
the hope of freedom after 20, 25, or 30 years. The law,
after all, granted the trial judge the discretion to impose
these lower sentences. See §2929.03(A)(1).
   This case did not present either the Ohio courts or this
Court the occasion to decide this important question.3 I
believe the Ohio courts will be vigilant in considering it in
the appropriate case.




——————
  2 Although the State argues that a defendant can present a claim of

bias on state postconviction proceedings, see Brief in Opposition 11,
those claims are limited to claims of “a consistent pattern of disparity
in sentencing by the judge,” Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §2953.21(A)(5). The
State does not address how a defendant convicted of aggravated murder
can raise a substantial claim of bias if it is not part of a “consistent
pattern.”
  3 Campbell advanced his meaningful-review claim as a due process,

rather than an Eighth Amendment, claim. He also argued that the
Ohio statute violated the Equal Protection Clause.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
GARCO CONSTRUCTION, INC. v. ROBERT M. SPEER,
      ACTING SECRETARY OF THE ARMY
   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED 

   STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT

              No. 17–225.   Decided March 19, 2018


  The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
  JUSTICE THOMAS, with whom JUSTICE GORSUCH joins,
dissenting from the denial of certiorari.
  Petitioner Garco Construction, Inc. (Garco), had a con-
tract with the Army Corps of Engineers to build housing
units on Malmstrom Air Force Base. As part of its con-
tract, Garco agreed to comply with all base access policies.
After construction began, the base denied access to certain
employees of Garco’s subcontractor. Although the text of
the base’s access policy required only a “wants and war-
rants” check, App. to Pet. for Cert. 105a, the base clarified
that the policy also required background checks and ex-
cluded many individuals with criminal histories—even if
those individuals did not have any wants or warrants.
Garco’s request for an equitable adjustment of the contract
was denied, and the Armed Services Board of Contract
Appeals denied Garco’s appeal. The Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit affirmed. Despite acknowledging
“some merit” to Garco’s argument that “ ‘wants and war-
rants’ ” means only wants and warrants, the Federal Cir-
cuit deferred to the base’s interpretation of its access
policy under Auer v. Robbins, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""118089""><a href=""/opinion/118089/auer-v-robbins/""><span class=""volume"">519</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">452</span></a></span><pre class=""inline""> (1997). </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">856</span>
<span class=""reporter"">F.3d</span> <span class=""page"">938</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 943 (2017).
  Garco filed a petition for certiorari, asking whether this
Court’s decisions in Auer, supra, and Bowles v. Seminole
Rock & Sand Co., </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""1087611""><a href=""/opinion/1087611/bowles-v-seminole-rock-sand-co/""><span class=""volume"">325</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">410</span></a></span><pre class=""inline""> (1945), should be over-
ruled. I would have granted certiorari to address that

question.
   Seminole Rock and Auer require courts to give “control-
ling weight” to an agency’s interpretation of its own regu-
lations. Seminole Rock, supra, at 414; accord, Auer, supra,
at 461. To qualify, an agency’s interpretation need not be
“the best” reading of the regulation. Decker v. Northwest
Environmental Defense Center, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">568</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">597</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 613 (2013).
It need only be a reading that is not “plainly erroneous or
inconsistent with the regulation.” Ibid. (internal quota-
tion marks omitted). Although Seminole Rock deference
was initially applied exclusively “in the price control con-
text and only to official agency interpretations,” Knudsen
& Wildermuth, Unearthing the Lost History of Seminole
Rock, 65 Emory L. J. 47, 52–53 (2015), this Court has
since expanded it to many contexts and to informal inter-
pretations. See id., at 52–53, 68–77, 86–92 (2015); Perez v.
Mortgage Bankers Assn., </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">575</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">___, ___–___ (2015)
(THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 3–4).
   Seminole Rock deference is constitutionally suspect. See
Mortgage Bankers, 575 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 8–16).
It transfers “the judge’s exercise of interpretive judgment
to the agency,” which is “not properly constituted to exer-
cise the judicial power.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 13). It also
undermines “the judicial ‘check’ on the political branches”
by ceding the courts’ authority to independently interpret
and apply legal texts. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 14). And it
results in an “accumulation of governmental powers” by
allowing the same agency that promulgated a regulation
to “change the meaning” of that regulation “at [its] discre-
tion.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 16). This Court has never
“put forward a persuasive justification” for Seminole Rock
deference. Decker, supra, at 617 (Scalia, J. concurring in
part and dissenting in part); see also Mortgage Bankers,
supra, at ___–___ (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (slip op., at 18–
23) (explaining why each of the proffered explanations for
the doctrine is unpersuasive).

                    THOMAS, J., dissenting

   By all accounts, Seminole Rock deference is “on its last
gasp.” United Student Aid Funds, Inc. v. Bible, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">578</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span>
<span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">___, ___ (2016) (THOMAS, J., dissenting from denial of
certiorari) (slip op., at 1). Several Members of this Court
have said that it merits reconsideration in an appropriate
case. See, e.g., Mortgage Bankers, 575 U. S., at ___–___
(ALITO, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)
(slip op., at 1–2); id., at ___ (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (slip
op., at 23); Decker, supra, at 615–616 (ROBERTS, C. J.,
concurring). Even the author of Auer came to doubt its
correctness. See Mortgage Bankers, supra, at ___–___
(Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 2–5);
Decker, supra, at 616–621 (opinion of Scalia, J.); Talk
America, Inc. v.

68–69 (2011) (Scalia, J., concurring).
   This would have been an ideal case to reconsider Semi-
nole Rock deference, as it illustrates the problems that the
doctrine creates. While Garco was performing its obliga-
tions under the contract, the base adopted an interpreta-
tion of its access policy that read “wants and warrants” to
include “wants or warrants, sex offenders, violent offend-
ers, those who are on probation, and those who are
in a pre-release program.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 60a. The
Federal Circuit deferred to that textually dubious inter-
pretation. </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">856</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.</span> <span class=""page"">3d</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, at 945. Thus, an agency was able to
unilaterally modify a contract by issuing a new “ ‘clarifica-

ion of Scalia, J.). This type of conduct “frustrates the
notice and predictability purposes of rulemaking, and
promotes arbitrary government.” Talk America, supra, at
69 (opinion of Scalia, J.).

military receives substantial deference on matters of

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
GARCO CONSTRUCTION, INC. v. ROBERT M. SPEER,
      ACTING SECRETARY OF THE ARMY
   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED 

   STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT

              No. 17–225.   Decided March 19, 2018


  The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
  JUSTICE THOMAS, with whom JUSTICE GORSUCH joins,
dissenting from the denial of certiorari.
  Petitioner Garco Construction, Inc. (Garco), had a con-
tract with the Army Corps of Engineers to build housing
units on Malmstrom Air Force Base. As part of its con-
tract, Garco agreed to comply with all base access policies.
After construction began, the base denied access to certain
employees of Garco’s subcontractor. Although the text of
the base’s access policy required only a “wants and war-
rants” check, App. to Pet. for Cert. 105a, the base clarified
that the policy also required background checks and ex-
cluded many individuals with criminal histories—even if
those individuals did not have any wants or warrants.
Garco’s request for an equitable adjustment of the contract
was denied, and the Armed Services Board of Contract
Appeals denied Garco’s appeal. The Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit affirmed. Despite acknowledging
“some merit” to Garco’s argument that “ ‘wants and war-
rants’ ” means only wants and warrants, the Federal Cir-
cuit deferred to the base’s interpretation of its access
policy under Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S. 452 (1997). 856
F. 3d 938, 943 (2017).
  Garco filed a petition for certiorari, asking whether this
Court’s decisions in Auer, supra, and Bowles v. Seminole
Rock & Sand Co., 325 U. S. 410 (1945), should be over-
ruled. I would have granted certiorari to address that
2           GARCO CONSTRUCTION, INC. v. SPEER

                      THOMAS, J., dissenting

question.
   Seminole Rock and Auer require courts to give “control-
ling weight” to an agency’s interpretation of its own regu-
lations. Seminole Rock, supra, at 414; accord, Auer, supra,
at 461. To qualify, an agency’s interpretation need not be
“the best” reading of the regulation. Decker v. Northwest
Environmental Defense Center, 568 U. S. 597, 613 (2013).
It need only be a reading that is not “plainly erroneous or
inconsistent with the regulation.” Ibid. (internal quota-
tion marks omitted). Although Seminole Rock deference
was initially applied exclusively “in the price control con-
text and only to official agency interpretations,” Knudsen
& Wildermuth, Unearthing the Lost History of Seminole
Rock, 65 Emory L. J. 47, 52–53 (2015), this Court has
since expanded it to many contexts and to informal inter-
pretations. See id., at 52–53, 68–77, 86–92 (2015); Perez v.
Mortgage Bankers Assn., 575 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2015)
(THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 3–4).
   Seminole Rock deference is constitutionally suspect. See
Mortgage Bankers, 575 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 8–16).
It transfers “the judge’s exercise of interpretive judgment
to the agency,” which is “not properly constituted to exer-
cise the judicial power.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 13). It also
undermines “the judicial ‘check’ on the political branches”
by ceding the courts’ authority to independently interpret
and apply legal texts. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 14). And it
results in an “accumulation of governmental powers” by
allowing the same agency that promulgated a regulation
to “change the meaning” of that regulation “at [its] discre-
tion.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 16). This Court has never
“put forward a persuasive justification” for Seminole Rock
deference. Decker, supra, at 617 (Scalia, J. concurring in
part and dissenting in part); see also Mortgage Bankers,
supra, at ___–___ (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (slip op., at 18–
23) (explaining why each of the proffered explanations for
the doctrine is unpersuasive).

                    THOMAS, J., dissenting

   By all accounts, Seminole Rock deference is “on its last
gasp.” United Student Aid Funds, Inc. v. Bible, 578 U. S.
___, ___ (2016) (THOMAS, J., dissenting from denial of
certiorari) (slip op., at 1). Several Members of this Court
have said that it merits reconsideration in an appropriate
case. See, e.g., Mortgage Bankers, 575 U. S., at ___–___
(ALITO, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)
(slip op., at 1–2); id., at ___ (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (slip
op., at 23); Decker, supra, at 615–616 (ROBERTS, C. J.,
concurring). Even the author of Auer came to doubt its
correctness. See Mortgage Bankers, supra, at ___–___
(Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 2–5);
Decker, supra, at 616–621 (opinion of Scalia, J.); Talk
America, Inc. v. Michigan Bell Telephone Co., 564 U. S. 50,
68–69 (2011) (Scalia, J., concurring).
   This would have been an ideal case to reconsider Semi-
nole Rock deference, as it illustrates the problems that the
doctrine creates. While Garco was performing its obliga-
tions under the contract, the base adopted an interpreta-
tion of its access policy that read “wants and warrants” to
include “wants or warrants, sex offenders, violent offend-
ers, those who are on probation, and those who are
in a pre-release program.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 60a. The
Federal Circuit deferred to that textually dubious inter-
pretation. 856 F. 3d, at 945. Thus, an agency was able to
unilaterally modify a contract by issuing a new “ ‘clarifica-
tion’ with retroactive effect.” Decker, supra, at 620 (opin-
ion of Scalia, J.). This type of conduct “frustrates the
notice and predictability purposes of rulemaking, and
promotes arbitrary government.” Talk America, supra, at
69 (opinion of Scalia, J.).
   True, the agency here is part of the military, and the
military receives substantial deference on matters of
policy. See Orloff v. Willoughby, 345 U. S. 83, 94 (1953).
But nothing about the military context of this case affects
the legitimacy of Seminole Rock deference. “The proper
4           GARCO CONSTRUCTION, INC. v. SPEER

question faced by courts in interpreting a regulation is . . .
what the regulation means.” Mortgage Bankers, 575 U. S.,
at ___ (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (slip op., at 18) (emphasis
added). While the military is far better equipped than
the courts to decide matters of tactics and security, it is
no better equipped to read legal texts. Pointing to the
military’s policy expertise “misidentifies the relevant
inquiry.” Ibid.
   Because this Court has passed up another opportunity
to remedy “precisely the accumulation of governmental
powers that the Framers warned against,” id., at ___
(slip op., at 16), I respectfully dissent from the denial of
certiorari.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
         ABEL DANIEL HIDALGO v. ARIZONA
  ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME 

                  COURT OF ARIZONA

             No. 17–251.   Decided March 19, 2018


  The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
  Statement of JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE
GINSBURG, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, and JUSTICE KAGAN join,
respecting the denial of certiorari.
  The petition in this capital case asks an important
Eighth Amendment question:
    “Whether Arizona’s capital sentencing scheme, which
    includes so many aggravating circumstances that vir-
    tually every defendant convicted of first-degree mur-
    der is eligible for death, violates the Eighth Amend-
    ment.” Pet. for Cert. (i).
                             I

class of persons eligible for the death penalty and must
reasonably justify the imposition of a more severe sen-
tence on the defendant compared to others found guilty of
murder.’ ” Lowenfield v. Phelps, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""111978""><a href=""/opinion/111978/lowenfield-v-phelps/""><span class=""volume"">484</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">231</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 244 (1988)

satisfy the “narrowing requirement,” a state legislature
must adopt “statutory factors which determine death
eligibility” and thereby “limit the class of murderers to
which the death penalty may be applied.” Brown v. Sand-
ers, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""145694""><a href=""/opinion/145694/brown-v-sanders/""><span class=""volume"">546</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">212</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 216, and n. 2 (2006) (emphasis added);

(“[S]tatutory aggravating circumstances play a constitu-
tionally necessary function at the stage of legislative defi-
nition: they circumscribe the class of persons eligible for

   The second aspect of the capital decisionmaking process,
the “selection decision,” determines whether a death-
eligible defendant should actually receive the death penalty.
Tuilaepa, supra, at 972. In making this individualized
determination, the jury must “consider relevant mitigating
evidence of the character and record of the defendant and
the circumstances of the crime.” Ibid.; see also Marsh,
supra, at 173–174 (“[A] state capital sentencing system
must . . . permit a jury to render a reasoned, individual-
ized sentencing determination based on a death-eligible
defendant’s record, personal characteristics, and the cir-
cumstances of his crime”). This second aspect of the capi-

tal punishment decision—the selection requirement—is
not before us.
                             II
    Our precedent makes clear that the legislature may
satisfy the “narrowing function . . . in either of . . . two
ways.” Lowenfield, 484 U. S., at 246. First, “[t]he legisla-
ture may itself narrow the definition of capital offenses . . . .”
Ibid. (emphasis added). Second, “the legislature may more
broadly define capital offenses,” but set forth by statute
“aggravating circumstances” which will permit the “jury
. . . at the penalty phase” to make “findings” that will
narrow the legislature’s broad definition of the capital
offense. Ibid.; see also Tuilaepa, supra, at 972 (“The
aggravating circumstance may be contained in the defini-
tion of the crime or in a separate sentencing factor (or in
both)”). The petitioner here, Abel Daniel Hidalgo, con-
tends that the Arizona Legislature has failed to satisfy
the narrowing requirement through either of these two
methods.
                                 A
    Consider the first way a state legislature may satisfy
the Constitution’s narrowing requirement—namely, by
enacting a narrow statutory definition of capital murder.
Some States have followed this approach. For example, in
Lowenfield, this Court upheld Louisiana’s use of this
method because it concluded that the State’s capital mur-
der statute narrowed the class of intentional murderers to
a smaller class of death-eligible murderers. 484 U. S., at
246. Specifically, Louisiana’s capital murder statute was
limited to cases in which “ ‘the offender’ ” not only had
“ ‘specific intent to kill or to inflict great bodily harm’ ” but
also (1) targeted one of three specifically enumerated
categories of victims (children, “ ‘a fireman or peace officer
engaged’ ” in “ ‘lawful duties,’ ” or multiple victims); or (2)
4                    HIDALGO v. ARIZONA

                     Statement of BREYER, J.

was “ ‘engaged in the perpetration or attempted perpetra-
tion of ’ ” certain other serious specified crimes; or (3) was a
murder-for-hire. Id., at 242 (quoting La. Rev. Stat. Ann.
§§14:30(A)(1)–(5) (West 1986)). The Lowenfield Court also
noted that Texas’ capital murder statute “narrowly de-
fined the categories of murder for which a death sentence
could be imposed.” 484 U. S., at 245; see also Jurek v.
Texas, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""109534""><a href=""/opinion/109534/jurek-v-texas/""><span class=""volume"">428</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">262</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 271 (1976) (joint opinion of Stewart,
Powell, and Stevens, JJ.) (upholding the Texas capital
murder statute, which made “a smaller class of murders in
Texas” death eligible).
   Unlike the Louisiana and Texas statutes, Arizona’s
capital murder statute makes all first-degree murderers
eligible for death and defines first-degree murder broadly
to include all premeditated homicides along with felony
murder based on 22 possible predicate felony offenses. See
Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§13–1105(A)(1)–(2) (2010) (includ-
ing, for example, transporting marijuana for sale). Per-
haps not surprisingly, Arizona did not argue below and
does not suggest now that the State’s first-degree murder
statute alone can meet the Eighth Amendment’s narrow-
ing requirement.
                              B
  Because Arizona law broadly defines capital murder, the
State has sought to comply with the narrowing require-
ment through the second method—namely, by setting
forth statutory “aggravating circumstances” designed to
permit the “jury . . . at the penalty phase” to make “find-
ings” that will narrow the legislature’s broad definition of
the capital offense. Lowenfield, supra, at 246. The Arizona
Legislature has set forth a list of statutory aggravating
factors that the jury must consider “in determining
whether to impose a sentence of death.” Ariz. Rev. Stat.
Ann. §13–751(F) (Cum. Supp. 2017); see Appendix, infra.
And under Arizona law, a person convicted of first-degree
                 Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)           5

                   Statement of BREYER, J.

murder may be sentenced to death only if at least one of
these aggravating factors is present. §13–752(E).
   In this case, the petitioner sought an evidentiary hear-
ing to establish through witnesses, expert testimony, and
documentary evidence that the statutory aggravating
circumstances set forth in §13–751(F) apply to virtually
every first-degree murder case in the State. The state
trial court consolidated the petitioner’s motion for an
evidentiary hearing with similar motions filed by 17 other
first-degree murder defendants. See Brief in Opposition 4.
Unlike the petitioner, the other defendants had committed
their crimes after the Arizona Legislature increased the
number of statutory aggravating factors from 10 to 14.
Compare Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §13–703(F) (2001) (10
aggravators) with Appendix, infra (14 aggravators).
   In his request for a hearing, the petitioner pointed to,
among other things, evidence he obtained through public
records requests regarding more than 860 first-degree
murder cases in Maricopa County (the county where he
was charged) between 2002 and 2012. As the Arizona
Supreme Court noted, this evidence indicated that “one or
more aggravating circumstances were present in 856 of
866” cases examined. </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">241</span> <span class=""reporter"">Ariz.</span> <span class=""page"">543</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 550, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">390</span> <span class=""reporter"">P.3d</span> <span class=""page"">783</span></span><pre class=""inline"">,
789 (2017). In other words, about 98% of first-degree
murder defendants were eligible for the death penalty.
The petitioner adds in his briefing before this Court that
this is true under either the 10 aggravating factors in
effect when he was sentenced or the 14 factors set forth
under the expanded provisions Arizona has since adopted.
See Reply Brief 5 (citing C. Spohn, Aggravating Circum-
stances in First-Degree Murder Cases, Maricopa County,
AZ: 2002–2012).       Narrowing an impermissibly broad
capital murder statute by about 2% is not, the petitioner
says, sufficient under this Court’s precedents.
   The state trial court denied the petitioner’s request for
an evidentiary hearing, and the Arizona Supreme Court
6                   HIDALGO v. ARIZONA

                    Statement of BREYER, J.

affirmed. 241 Ariz., at 548–549, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">390</span> <span class=""reporter"">P.</span> <span class=""page"">3d</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, at 788–789.
However, the Arizona Supreme Court did not dispute the
petitioner’s evidence. It assumed that “Hidalgo is right in
his factual assertion that nearly every charged first degree
murder could support at least one aggravating circum-
stance.” Id., at 551, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">390</span> <span class=""reporter"">P.</span> <span class=""page"">3d</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, at 791.
                             C
   Despite assuming that the aggravating circumstances
fail to materially narrow the class of death-eligible first-
degree murder defendants, the Arizona Supreme Court
nevertheless concluded that the State’s death penalty
system meets the Constitution’s narrowing requirement.
It said that the petitioner was “mistaken . . . insofar as he
focuses only on the legislatively defined aggravating cir-
cumstances” because use of those circumstances “is not the
only way in which Arizona’s sentencing scheme narrows
the class of persons eligible for death.” Id., at 551–552,
</pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">390</span> <span class=""reporter"">P.</span> <span class=""page"">3d</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, at 791–792. The Arizona Supreme Court men-
tioned five other ways it thought Arizona’s death penalty
system meets the Constitution’s narrowing requirement.
They were: (1) Arizona’s first-degree murder statute; (2)
the “identified aggravating circumstances”; (3) the fact
that the State must prove “one or more” of the “alleged
aggravating circumstances” “beyond a reasonable doubt”;
(4) the existence of “mandatory appellate review”; and (5)
Arizona’s statutory provisions applicable to “individual-
ized sentencing determinations” through consideration of
“mitigating circumstances.” Id., at 552, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">390</span> <span class=""reporter"">P.</span> <span class=""page"">3d</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, at 792.
   We have considered (and rejected) the first of these
other ways since Arizona’s first-degree murder statute
does not “provid[e] for categorical narrowing at the defini-
tion stage.” Zant, 462 U. S., at 879. What about the
second way—that is, narrowing by means of the “statutory
aggravators”? Again, the Arizona Supreme Court as-
sumed that those factors do not, in fact, narrow the class
                  Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)            7

                    Statement of BREYER, J.

of death-eligible first-degree murder defendants. Instead
it assumed that “Hidalgo is right in his factual assertion
that nearly every charged first degree murder could sup-
port at least one aggravating circumstance.” 241 Ariz., at
551, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">390</span> <span class=""reporter"">P.</span> <span class=""page"">3d</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, at 791. That assumption, without more,
would seem to deny the constitutional need to “genuinely”
narrow the class of death-eligible defendants. Zant, su-
pra, at 877. Moreover, the third and fourth narrowing
methods the Arizona Supreme Court invoked are basically
beside the point—they do not show the necessary legisla-
tive narrowing that our precedents require. And the final
other way (individualized sentencing determinations)
concerns an entirely different capital punishment re-
quirement—the selection decision—which is not at issue in
this case. See supra, at 2–3.
   Finally, the Arizona Supreme Court seemed to suggest
that prosecutors may perform the narrowing requirement

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
         ABEL DANIEL HIDALGO v. ARIZONA
  ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME 

                  COURT OF ARIZONA

             No. 17–251.   Decided March 19, 2018


  The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
  Statement of JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE
GINSBURG, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, and JUSTICE KAGAN join,
respecting the denial of certiorari.
  The petition in this capital case asks an important
Eighth Amendment question:
    “Whether Arizona’s capital sentencing scheme, which
    includes so many aggravating circumstances that vir-
    tually every defendant convicted of first-degree mur-
    der is eligible for death, violates the Eighth Amend-
    ment.” Pet. for Cert. (i).
                             I
  “Our capital punishment cases under the Eighth
Amendment address two different aspects of the capital
decisionmaking process: the eligibility decision and the
selection decision.” Tuilaepa v. California, 512 U. S. 967,
971 (1994). States must comply with requirements for
each decision. See Kansas v. Marsh, 548 U. S. 163, 173–
174 (2006) (“Together, our decisions in Furman v. Georgia,
408 U. S. 238 (1972) (per curiam), and Gregg v. Georgia,
428 U. S. 153 (1976) (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell,
and Stevens, JJ.), establish that a state capital sentenc-
ing scheme must” comport with requirements for each
decision).
  In respect to the first, the “eligibility decision,” our
precedent imposes what is commonly known as the “nar-
rowing” requirement. “To pass constitutional muster, a
2                   HIDALGO v. ARIZONA

                    Statement of BREYER, J.

capital sentencing scheme must ‘genuinely narrow the
class of persons eligible for the death penalty and must
reasonably justify the imposition of a more severe sen-
tence on the defendant compared to others found guilty of
murder.’ ” Lowenfield v. Phelps, 484 U. S. 231, 244 (1988)
(quoting Zant v. Stephens, 462 U. S. 862, 877 (1983)). To
satisfy the “narrowing requirement,” a state legislature
must adopt “statutory factors which determine death
eligibility” and thereby “limit the class of murderers to
which the death penalty may be applied.” Brown v. Sand-
ers, 546 U. S. 212, 216, and n. 2 (2006) (emphasis added);
see also Tuilaepa, supra, at 979 (“ ‘Once the jury finds that
the defendant falls within the legislatively defined category
of persons eligible for the death penalty, . . . the jury then
is free to consider a myriad of factors to determine whether
death is the appropriate punishment’ ” (quoting Califor-
nia v. Ramos, 463 U. S. 992, 1008 (1983); emphasis
added)); Lowenfield, supra, at 246 (specifying that the
“legislature” may provide for the “narrowing function”
by statute (emphasis added)); Zant, supra, at 878
(“[S]tatutory aggravating circumstances play a constitu-
tionally necessary function at the stage of legislative defi-
nition: they circumscribe the class of persons eligible for
the death penalty” (emphasis added)).
   The second aspect of the capital decisionmaking process,
the “selection decision,” determines whether a death-
eligible defendant should actually receive the death penalty.
Tuilaepa, supra, at 972. In making this individualized
determination, the jury must “consider relevant mitigating
evidence of the character and record of the defendant and
the circumstances of the crime.” Ibid.; see also Marsh,
supra, at 173–174 (“[A] state capital sentencing system
must . . . permit a jury to render a reasoned, individual-
ized sentencing determination based on a death-eligible
defendant’s record, personal characteristics, and the cir-
cumstances of his crime”). This second aspect of the capi-
                   Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)               3

                     Statement of BREYER, J.

tal punishment decision—the selection requirement—is
not before us.
                             II
    Our precedent makes clear that the legislature may
satisfy the “narrowing function . . . in either of . . . two
ways.” Lowenfield, 484 U. S., at 246. First, “[t]he legisla-
ture may itself narrow the definition of capital offenses . . . .”
Ibid. (emphasis added). Second, “the legislature may more
broadly define capital offenses,” but set forth by statute
“aggravating circumstances” which will permit the “jury
. . . at the penalty phase” to make “findings” that will
narrow the legislature’s broad definition of the capital
offense. Ibid.; see also Tuilaepa, supra, at 972 (“The
aggravating circumstance may be contained in the defini-
tion of the crime or in a separate sentencing factor (or in
both)”). The petitioner here, Abel Daniel Hidalgo, con-
tends that the Arizona Legislature has failed to satisfy
the narrowing requirement through either of these two
methods.
                                 A
    Consider the first way a state legislature may satisfy
the Constitution’s narrowing requirement—namely, by
enacting a narrow statutory definition of capital murder.
Some States have followed this approach. For example, in
Lowenfield, this Court upheld Louisiana’s use of this
method because it concluded that the State’s capital mur-
der statute narrowed the class of intentional murderers to
a smaller class of death-eligible murderers. 484 U. S., at
246. Specifically, Louisiana’s capital murder statute was
limited to cases in which “ ‘the offender’ ” not only had
“ ‘specific intent to kill or to inflict great bodily harm’ ” but
also (1) targeted one of three specifically enumerated
categories of victims (children, “ ‘a fireman or peace officer
engaged’ ” in “ ‘lawful duties,’ ” or multiple victims); or (2)
4                    HIDALGO v. ARIZONA

                     Statement of BREYER, J.

was “ ‘engaged in the perpetration or attempted perpetra-
tion of ’ ” certain other serious specified crimes; or (3) was a
murder-for-hire. Id., at 242 (quoting La. Rev. Stat. Ann.
§§14:30(A)(1)–(5) (West 1986)). The Lowenfield Court also
noted that Texas’ capital murder statute “narrowly de-
fined the categories of murder for which a death sentence
could be imposed.” 484 U. S., at 245; see also Jurek v.
Texas, 428 U. S. 262, 271 (1976) (joint opinion of Stewart,
Powell, and Stevens, JJ.) (upholding the Texas capital
murder statute, which made “a smaller class of murders in
Texas” death eligible).
   Unlike the Louisiana and Texas statutes, Arizona’s
capital murder statute makes all first-degree murderers
eligible for death and defines first-degree murder broadly
to include all premeditated homicides along with felony
murder based on 22 possible predicate felony offenses. See
Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§13–1105(A)(1)–(2) (2010) (includ-
ing, for example, transporting marijuana for sale). Per-
haps not surprisingly, Arizona did not argue below and
does not suggest now that the State’s first-degree murder
statute alone can meet the Eighth Amendment’s narrow-
ing requirement.
                              B
  Because Arizona law broadly defines capital murder, the
State has sought to comply with the narrowing require-
ment through the second method—namely, by setting
forth statutory “aggravating circumstances” designed to
permit the “jury . . . at the penalty phase” to make “find-
ings” that will narrow the legislature’s broad definition of
the capital offense. Lowenfield, supra, at 246. The Arizona
Legislature has set forth a list of statutory aggravating
factors that the jury must consider “in determining
whether to impose a sentence of death.” Ariz. Rev. Stat.
Ann. §13–751(F) (Cum. Supp. 2017); see Appendix, infra.
And under Arizona law, a person convicted of first-degree
                 Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)           5

                   Statement of BREYER, J.

murder may be sentenced to death only if at least one of
these aggravating factors is present. §13–752(E).
   In this case, the petitioner sought an evidentiary hear-
ing to establish through witnesses, expert testimony, and
documentary evidence that the statutory aggravating
circumstances set forth in §13–751(F) apply to virtually
every first-degree murder case in the State. The state
trial court consolidated the petitioner’s motion for an
evidentiary hearing with similar motions filed by 17 other
first-degree murder defendants. See Brief in Opposition 4.
Unlike the petitioner, the other defendants had committed
their crimes after the Arizona Legislature increased the
number of statutory aggravating factors from 10 to 14.
Compare Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §13–703(F) (2001) (10
aggravators) with Appendix, infra (14 aggravators).
   In his request for a hearing, the petitioner pointed to,
among other things, evidence he obtained through public
records requests regarding more than 860 first-degree
murder cases in Maricopa County (the county where he
was charged) between 2002 and 2012. As the Arizona
Supreme Court noted, this evidence indicated that “one or
more aggravating circumstances were present in 856 of
866” cases examined. 241 Ariz. 543, 550, 390 P. 3d 783,
789 (2017). In other words, about 98% of first-degree
murder defendants were eligible for the death penalty.
The petitioner adds in his briefing before this Court that
this is true under either the 10 aggravating factors in
effect when he was sentenced or the 14 factors set forth
under the expanded provisions Arizona has since adopted.
See Reply Brief 5 (citing C. Spohn, Aggravating Circum-
stances in First-Degree Murder Cases, Maricopa County,
AZ: 2002–2012).       Narrowing an impermissibly broad
capital murder statute by about 2% is not, the petitioner
says, sufficient under this Court’s precedents.
   The state trial court denied the petitioner’s request for
an evidentiary hearing, and the Arizona Supreme Court
6                   HIDALGO v. ARIZONA

                    Statement of BREYER, J.

affirmed. 241 Ariz., at 548–549, 390 P. 3d, at 788–789.
However, the Arizona Supreme Court did not dispute the
petitioner’s evidence. It assumed that “Hidalgo is right in
his factual assertion that nearly every charged first degree
murder could support at least one aggravating circum-
stance.” Id., at 551, 390 P. 3d, at 791.
                             C
   Despite assuming that the aggravating circumstances
fail to materially narrow the class of death-eligible first-
degree murder defendants, the Arizona Supreme Court
nevertheless concluded that the State’s death penalty
system meets the Constitution’s narrowing requirement.
It said that the petitioner was “mistaken . . . insofar as he
focuses only on the legislatively defined aggravating cir-
cumstances” because use of those circumstances “is not the
only way in which Arizona’s sentencing scheme narrows
the class of persons eligible for death.” Id., at 551–552,
390 P. 3d, at 791–792. The Arizona Supreme Court men-
tioned five other ways it thought Arizona’s death penalty
system meets the Constitution’s narrowing requirement.
They were: (1) Arizona’s first-degree murder statute; (2)
the “identified aggravating circumstances”; (3) the fact
that the State must prove “one or more” of the “alleged
aggravating circumstances” “beyond a reasonable doubt”;
(4) the existence of “mandatory appellate review”; and (5)
Arizona’s statutory provisions applicable to “individual-
ized sentencing determinations” through consideration of
“mitigating circumstances.” Id., at 552, 390 P. 3d, at 792.
   We have considered (and rejected) the first of these
other ways since Arizona’s first-degree murder statute
does not “provid[e] for categorical narrowing at the defini-
tion stage.” Zant, 462 U. S., at 879. What about the
second way—that is, narrowing by means of the “statutory
aggravators”? Again, the Arizona Supreme Court as-
sumed that those factors do not, in fact, narrow the class
                  Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)            7

                    Statement of BREYER, J.

of death-eligible first-degree murder defendants. Instead
it assumed that “Hidalgo is right in his factual assertion
that nearly every charged first degree murder could sup-
port at least one aggravating circumstance.” 241 Ariz., at
551, 390 P. 3d, at 791. That assumption, without more,
would seem to deny the constitutional need to “genuinely”
narrow the class of death-eligible defendants. Zant, su-
pra, at 877. Moreover, the third and fourth narrowing
methods the Arizona Supreme Court invoked are basically
beside the point—they do not show the necessary legisla-
tive narrowing that our precedents require. And the final
other way (individualized sentencing determinations)
concerns an entirely different capital punishment re-
quirement—the selection decision—which is not at issue in
this case. See supra, at 2–3.
   Finally, the Arizona Supreme Court seemed to suggest
that prosecutors may perform the narrowing requirement
by choosing to ask for the death penalty only in those
cases in which a particularly wrongful first-degree murder
is at issue. See 241 Ariz., at 551–552, 390 P. 3d, at 791–
792. However, that reasoning cannot be squared with this
Court’s precedent—precedent that insists that States
perform the “constitutionally necessary” narrowing func-
tion “at the stage of legislative definition.” Zant, supra, at
878 (emphasis added); see also Tuilaepa, 512 U. S., at 979;
Lowenfield, 484 U. S., at 246; Ramos, 463 U. S., at 1008.

   JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR

and the denial of certiorari.
   Petitioner Doyle Lee Hamm is a 61-year-old Alabama
inmate whose medical conditions leave him in a vulnera-
ble physical state. An independent physician, appointed
by the District Court, determined that “no veins in either
[of his arms] would be readily accessible” for the place-
ment of the two intravenous catheters Alabama’s lethal-
injection execution protocol requires. Hamm v. Commis-
sioner, Alabama Department of Corrections, No. 18–10636
(CA11, Feb. 22, 2018), p. 5. Nonetheless, a panel of the
Eleventh Circuit has affirmed the District Court’s denial
of Hamm’s request for a preliminary injunction barring
intravenous lethal injection. The District Court and Elev-
enth Circuit erroneously premised their rejection of
Hamm’s claims on novel understandings about how
Hamm’s execution would be carried out—understandings
gleaned from a stipulation and an affidavit to which
Hamm was given no opportunity to respond. An adversar-
ial process should have tested the risk of “serious illness

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
          THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT

   No. 16–424.      Argued October 4, 2017—Decided February 21, 2018
A federal grand jury indicted petitioner, Rodney Class, for possessing
  firearms in his locked jeep, which was parked on the grounds of the
  United States Capitol in Washington, D. C.             See </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">40</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">.
  §5104(e)(1) (“An individual . . . may not carry . . . on the Grounds or
  in any of the Capitol Buildings a firearm”). Appearing pro se, Class
  asked the District Court to dismiss the indictment. He alleged that
  the statute, §5104(e), violates the Second Amendment and the Due
  Process Clause. After the District Court dismissed both claims, Class
  pleaded guilty to “Possession of a Firearm on U. S. Capitol Grounds,
  in violation of </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">40</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §5104(e).” App. 30. A written plea agree-
  ment set forth the terms of Class’ guilty plea, including several cate-
  gories of rights that he agreed to waive. The agreement said nothing
  about the right to challenge on direct appeal the constitutionality of
  the statute of conviction. After conducting a hearing pursuant to
  Rule 11(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the District
  Court accepted Class’ guilty plea and sentenced him. Soon thereaf-
  ter, Class sought to raise his constitutional claims on direct appeal.
  The Court of Appeals held that Class could not do so because, by
  pleading guilty, he had waived his constitutional claims.
Held: A guilty plea, by itself, does not bar a federal criminal defendant
 from challenging the constitutionality of his statute of conviction on
 direct appeal. Pp. 3–11.
    (a) This holding flows directly from this Court’s prior decisions.
 Fifty years ago, in Haynes v. United States, the Court addressed a
 similar claim challenging the constitutionality of a criminal statute.
 Justice Harlan’s opinion for the Court stated that the defendant’s
 “plea of guilty did not, of course, waive his previous [constitutional]
2                       CLASS v. UNITED STATES

    claim.” </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""107608""><a href=""/opinion/107608/haynes-v-united-states/""><span class=""volume"">390</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">85</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 87, n. 2. That clear statement reflects an un-
    derstanding of the nature of guilty pleas that stretches, in broad out-
    line, nearly 150 years. Subsequent decisions have elaborated upon it.
    In Blackledge v. Perry, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""109042""><a href=""/opinion/109042/blackledge-v-perry/""><span class=""volume"">417</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">21</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, the Court recognized that a
    guilty plea bars some “ ‘antecedent constitutional violations,’ ” related
    to events (such as grand jury proceedings) that “ ‘occu[r] prior to the
    entry of the guilty plea.’ ” Id., at 30 (quoting Tollett v. Henderson,
    </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""108762""><a href=""/opinion/108762/tollett-v-henderson/""><span class=""volume"">411</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">258</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 266–267). However, where the claim implicates “the
    very power of the State” to prosecute the defendant, a guilty plea
    cannot by itself bar it. 417 U. S., at 30. Likewise, in Menna v. New
    York, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""109330""><a href=""/opinion/109330/menna-v-new-york/""><span class=""volume"">423</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">61</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, the Court held that because the defendant’s claim
    was that “the State may not convict [him] no matter how validly his
    factual guilt is established,” his “guilty plea, therefore, [did] not bar
    the claim.” Id., at 63, n. 2. In more recent years, the Court has reaf-
    firmed the Menna-Blackledge doctrine’s basic teaching that “ ‘a plea
    of guilty to a charge does not waive a claim that—judged on its face—
    the charge is one which the State may not constitutionally prose-
    cute.’ ” United States v. Broce, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""112177""><a href=""/opinion/112177/united-states-v-broce/""><span class=""volume"">488</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">563</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 575 (quoting Menna,
    supra, at 63, n. 2). Pp. 3–7.
       (b) In this case, Class neither expressly nor implicitly waived his
    constitutional claims by pleading guilty. As this Court understands
    them, the claims at issue here do not contradict the terms of the in-
    dictment or the written plea agreement and they can be resolved “on
    the basis of the existing record.” Broce, supra, at 575. Class chal-
    lenges the Government’s power to criminalize his (admitted) conduct
    and thereby calls into question the Government’s power to “ ‘constitu-
    tionally prosecute’ ” him. Ibid. (quoting Menna, supra, at 61–62, n.
    2). A guilty plea does not bar a direct appeal in these circumstances.
    Pp. 7–8.
       (c) Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(a)(2), which governs
    “conditional” guilty pleas, cannot resolve this case. By its own terms,
    the Rule does not say whether it sets forth the exclusive procedure
    for a defendant to preserve a constitutional claim following a guilty
    plea. And the Rule’s drafters acknowledged that the “Supreme Court
    has held that certain kinds of constitutional objections may be raised
    after a plea of guilty” and specifically stated that Rule 11(a)(2) “has
    no application” to the “kinds of constitutional objections” that may be
    raised under the “Menna-Blackledge doctrine.” Advisory Committee’s

    App., p. 912. Because the applicability of the Menna-Blackledge doc-
    trine is at issue here, Rule 11(a)(2) cannot resolve this case. Pp. 8–

  RODNEY CLASS, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES
 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

    APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT

                              [February 21, 2018]


  JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.
  Does a guilty plea bar a criminal defendant from later
appealing his conviction on the ground that the statute of
conviction violates the Constitution? In our view, a guilty
plea by itself does not bar that appeal.
                              I
   In September 2013, a federal grand jury indicted peti-
tioner, Rodney Class, for possessing firearms in his locked
jeep, which was parked in a lot on the grounds of the
United States Capitol in Washington, D. C. See </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">40</span>
<span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §5104(e)(1) (“An individual . . . may not carry . . .
on the Grounds or in any of the Capitol Buildings a fire-
arm”). Soon thereafter, Class, appearing pro se, asked the
Federal District Court for the District of Columbia to
dismiss the indictment. As relevant here, Class alleged
that the statute, §5104(e), violates the Second Amend-
ment. App. in No. 15–3015 (CADC), pp. 32–33. He also
raised a due process claim, arguing that he was denied
fair notice that weapons were banned in the parking lot.
Id., at 39. Following a hearing, the District Court denied
both claims. App. to Pet. for Cert. 9a.
   Several months later, Class pleaded guilty to “Posses-
2                 CLASS v. UNITED STATES

                     Opinion of the Court

sion of a Firearm on U. S. Capitol Grounds, in violation of
</pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">40</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §5104(e).” App. 30. The Government agreed to
drop related charges. Id., at 31.
   A written plea agreement set forth the terms of Class’
guilty plea, including several categories of rights that he
expressly agreed to waive. Those express waivers included:
(1) all defenses based upon the statute of limitations;
(2) several specified trial rights; (3) the right to appeal a
sentence at or below the judicially determined, maximum
sentencing guideline range; (4) most collateral attacks on
the conviction and sentence; and (5) various rights to
request or receive information concerning the investiga-
tion and prosecution of his criminal case. Id., at 38–42.
At the same time, the plea agreement expressly enumer-
ated categories of claims that Class could raise on appeal,
including claims based upon (1) newly discovered evi-
dence; (2) ineffective assistance of counsel; and (3) certain
statutes providing for sentence reductions. Id., at 41.
Finally, the plea agreement stated under the heading
“Complete Agreement”:
    “No agreements, promises, understandings, or repre-
    sentations have been made by the parties or their
    counsel other than those contained in writing herein,
    nor will any such agreements . . . be made unless
    committed to writing and signed . . . .” Id., at 45.
The agreement said nothing about the right to raise on
direct appeal a claim that the statute of conviction was
unconstitutional.
    The District Court held a plea hearing during which it
reviewed the terms of the plea agreement (with Class
present and under oath) to ensure the validity of the plea.
See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11(b); United States v. Ruiz, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""121166""><a href=""/opinion/121166/united-states-v-ruiz/""><span class=""volume"">536</span>
<span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">622</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 629 (2002) (defendant’s guilty plea must be
“ ‘voluntary’ ” and “related waivers” must be made “ ‘know-
ing[ly], intelligent[ly], [and] with sufficient awareness of

                      Opinion of the Court

the relevant circumstances and likely consequences’ ”).
After providing Class with the required information and
warnings, the District Court accepted his guilty plea.
Class was sentenced to 24 days imprisonment followed by
12 months of supervised release.
  Several days later, Class appealed his conviction to the
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Class was appointed an amicus to aid him in presenting
his arguments. He repeated his constitutional claims,
namely, that the statute violates the Second Amendment
and the Due Process Clause because it fails to give fair
notice of which areas fall within the Capitol Grounds
where firearms are banned. The Court of Appeals held
that Class could not raise his constitutional claims be-
cause, by pleading guilty, he had waived them. App. to
Pet. for Cert. 1a–5a. Class filed a petition for certiorari in
this Court asking us to decide whether in pleading guilty a
criminal defendant inherently waives the right to chal-
lenge the constitutionality of his statute of conviction. We
agreed to do so.
                              II
   The question is whether a guilty plea by itself bars a
federal criminal defendant from challenging the constitu-
tionality of the statute of conviction on direct appeal. We
hold that it does not. Class did not relinquish his right to
appeal the District Court’s constitutional determinations
simply by pleading guilty. As we shall explain, this hold-
ing flows directly from this Court’s prior decisions.
   Fifty years ago this Court directly addressed a similar

tutional). And the Court stated that a defendant’s “plea of
guilty did not . . . waive his previous [constitutional]
claim.” Haynes v. United States, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""107608""><a href=""/opinion/107608/haynes-v-united-states/""><span class=""volume"">390</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">85</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 87, n. 2
(1968). Though Justice Harlan’s opinion for the Court in
Haynes offered little explanation for this statement, sub-

                      Opinion of the Court

sequent decisions offered a rationale that applies here.
   In Blackledge v. Perry, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""109042""><a href=""/opinion/109042/blackledge-v-perry/""><span class=""volume"">417</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">21</span></a></span><pre class=""inline""> (1974), North Caro-
lina indicted and convicted Jimmy Seth Perry on a mis-
demeanor assault charge. When Perry exercised his right
under a North Carolina statute to a de novo trial in a
higher court, the State reindicted him, but this time the
State charged a felony, which carried a heavier penalty,
for the same conduct. Perry pleaded guilty. He then
sought habeas relief on the grounds that the reindictment
amounted to an unconstitutional vindictive prosecution.
The State argued that Perry’s guilty plea barred him from
raising his constitutional challenge. But this Court held
that it did not.
   The Court noted that a guilty plea bars appeal of many
claims, including some “ ‘antecedent constitutional viola-
tions’ ” related to events (say, grand jury proceedings) that
had “ ‘occurred prior to the entry of the guilty plea.’ ” Id.,
at 30 (quoting Tollett v. Henderson, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""108762""><a href=""/opinion/108762/tollett-v-henderson/""><span class=""volume"">411</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">258</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 266–
267 (1973)). While Tollett claims were “of constitutional
dimension,” the Court explained that “the nature of the
underlying constitutional infirmity is markedly different”
from a claim of vindictive prosecution, which implicates
“the very power of the State” to prosecute the defendant.
Blackledge, 417 U. S., at 30. Accordingly, the Court wrote
that “the right” Perry “asserts and that we today accept is
the right not to be haled into court at all upon the felony
charge” since “[t]he very initiation of the proceedings”
against Perry “operated to deprive him due process of
law.” Id., at 30–31.
   A year and a half later, in Menna v. New York, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""109330""><a href=""/opinion/109330/menna-v-new-york/""><span class=""volume"">423</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span>
<span class=""page"">61</span></a></span><pre class=""inline""> (1975) (per curiam), this Court repeated what it had
said and held in Blackledge. After Menna served a 30-day
jail term for refusing to testify before the grand jury on
November 7, 1968, the State of New York charged him
once again for (what Menna argued was) the same crime.
Menna pleaded guilty, but subsequently appealed arguing

                     Opinion of the Court

that the new charge violated the Double Jeopardy Clause.
U. S. Const., Amdt. 5. The lower courts held that Menna’s
constitutional claim had been “waived” by his guilty plea.
  This Court reversed. Citing Blackledge, supra, at 30,
the Court held that “a plea of guilty to a charge does not
waive a claim that—judged on its face—the charge is one
which the State may not constitutionally prosecute.”
Menna, 423 U. S., at 63, and n. 2. Menna’s claim amounted
to a claim that “the State may not convict” him “no
matter how validly his factual guilt is established.” Ibid.
Menna’s “guilty plea, therefore, [did] not bar the claim.”
Ibid.
  These holdings reflect an understanding of the nature of
guilty pleas which, in broad outline, stretches back nearly
150 years. In 1869 Justice Ames wrote for the Supreme
Judicial Court of Massachusetts:
    “The plea of guilty is, of course, a confession of all the
    facts charged in the indictment, and also of the evil
    intent imputed to the defendant. It is a waiver also of
    all merely technical and formal objections of which the
    defendant could have availed himself by any other
    plea or motion. But if the facts alleged and admitted
    do not constitute a crime against the laws of the
    Commonwealth, the defendant is entitled to be dis-
    charged.” Commonwealth v. Hinds, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">101</span> <span class=""reporter"">Mass.</span> <span class=""page"">209</span></span><pre class=""inline"">,
    210.
   Decisions of federal and state courts throughout the
19th and 20th centuries reflect a similar view of the na-
ture of a guilty plea. See United States v. Ury, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""1494447""><a href=""/opinion/1494447/united-states-v-ury/""><span class=""volume"">106</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.2d</span>

crime has been committed, for it is “the settled rule that,”
despite a guilty plea, a defendant “may urge” such a con-
tention “in the reviewing court”); Carper v. State, 27 Ohio
St. 572, 575 (1875) (same). We refer to these cases be-
cause it was against this background that Justice Harlan
in his opinion for the Court made the statement to which
we originally referred, namely, that a defendant’s “plea of
guilty did not, of course, waive his previous [constitution-
al] claim.” Haynes, 390 U. S., at 87, n. 2 (citing Ury, su-
pra, at 28).
   In more recent years, we have reaffirmed the Menna-
Blackledge doctrine and refined its scope. In United States
v. Broce, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""112177""><a href=""/opinion/112177/united-states-v-broce/""><span class=""volume"">488</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">563</span></a></span><pre class=""inline""> (1989), the defendants pleaded
guilty to two separate indictments in a single proceeding
which “on their face” described two separate bid-rigging
conspiracies. Id., at 576. They later sought to challenge
their convictions on double jeopardy grounds, arguing that
they had only admitted to one conspiracy. Citing Black-
ledge and Menna, this Court repeated that a guilty plea
does not bar a claim on appeal “where on the face of the
record the court had no power to enter the conviction or
impose the sentence.” 488 U. S., at 569. However, be-
cause the defendants could not “prove their claim by rely-
ing on those indictments and the existing record” and
“without contradicting those indictments,” this Court held
that their claims were “foreclosed by the admissions in-
herent in their guilty pleas.” Id., at 576.
   Unlike the claims in Broce, Class’ constitutional claims
here, as we understand them, do not contradict the terms
of the indictment or the written plea agreement. They are
consistent with Class’ knowing, voluntary, and intelligent
admission that he did what the indictment alleged. Those
claims can be “resolved without any need to venture be-
yond that record.” Id., at 575.
   Nor do Class’ claims focus upon case-related constitu-
tional defects that “ ‘occurred prior to the entry of the
                  Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)            7

                      Opinion of the Court

guilty plea.’ ” Blackledge, 417 U. S., at 30. They could not,
for example, “have been ‘cured’ through a new indictment
by a properly selected grand jury.” Ibid. (citing Tollett,
411 U. S., at 267). Because the defendant has admitted
the charges against him, a guilty plea makes the latter
kind of constitutional claim “irrelevant to the constitu-
tional validity of the conviction.” Haring v. Prosise, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""110961""><a href=""/opinion/110961/haring-v-prosise/""><span class=""volume"">462</span>
<span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">306</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 321 (1983). But the cases to which we have
referred make clear that a defendant’s guilty plea does not
make irrelevant the kind of constitutional claim Class
seeks to make.
    In sum, the claims at issue here do not fall within any of
the categories of claims that Class’ plea agreement forbids
him to raise on direct appeal. They challenge the Gov-
ernment’s power to criminalize Class’ (admitted) conduct.
They thereby call into question the Government’s power to
“ ‘constitutionally prosecute’ ” him. Broce, supra, at 575
(quoting Menna, supra, at 61–62, n. 2). A guilty plea does
not bar a direct appeal in these circumstances.
                              III
   We are not convinced by the three basic arguments that
the Government and the dissent make in reply.
   First, the Government contends that by entering a
guilty plea, Class inherently relinquished his constitu-
tional claims. The Government is correct that a guilty
plea does implicitly waive some claims, including some
constitutional claims. However, as we explained in Part
II, supra, Class’ valid guilty plea does not, by itself,
bar direct appeal of his constitutional claims in these
circumstances.
   As an initial matter, a valid guilty plea “forgoes not only
a fair trial, but also other accompanying constitutional
guarantees.” Ruiz, 536 U. S., at 628–629. While those
“simultaneously” relinquished rights include the privilege
against compulsory self-incrimination, the jury trial right,
8                 CLASS v. UNITED STATES

                      Opinion of the Court

and the right to confront accusers, McCarthy v. United
States, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""107892""><a href=""/opinion/107892/mccarthy-v-united-states/""><span class=""volume"">394</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">459</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 466 (1969), they do not include “a
waiver of the privileges which exist beyond the confines of
the trial.” Mitchell v. United States, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""118278""><a href=""/opinion/118278/mitchell-v-united-states/""><span class=""volume"">526</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">314</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 324
(1999). Here, Class’ statutory right directly to appeal his
conviction “cannot in any way be characterized as part of
the trial.” Lafler v. Cooper, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">566</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">156</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 165 (2012).
   A valid guilty plea also renders irrelevant—and thereby
prevents the defendant from appealing—the constitution-
ality of case-related government conduct that takes place
before the plea is entered. See, e.g., Haring, supra, at 320
(holding a valid guilty plea “results in the defendant’s loss
of any meaningful opportunity he might otherwise have
had to challenge the admissibility of evidence obtained in
violation of the Fourth Amendment”). Neither can the
defendant later complain that the indicting grand jury
was unconstitutionally selected. Tollett, supra, at 266.
But, as we have said, those kinds of claims are not at issue
here.
   Finally, a valid guilty plea relinquishes any claim that
would contradict the “admissions necessarily made upon
entry of a voluntary plea of guilty.” Broce, supra, at 573–
574. But the constitutional claim at issue here is con-
sistent with Class’ admission that he engaged in the con-
duct alleged in the indictment. Unlike the defendants in
Broce, Class’ challenge does not in any way deny that he
engaged in the conduct to which he admitted. Instead,
like the defendants in Blackledge and Menna, he seeks to
raise a claim which, “ ‘judged on its face’ ” based upon the
existing record, would extinguish the government’s power
to “ ‘constitutionally prosecute’ ” the defendant if the claim
were successful. Broce, supra, at 575 (quoting Menna, 423
U. S., at 62–63, and n. 2).
   Second, the Government and the dissent point to Rule
11(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which
governs “conditional” guilty pleas. The Rule states:
                 Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)            9

                     Opinion of the Court

    “Conditional Plea. With the consent of the court and
    the government, a defendant may enter a conditional
    plea of guilty or nolo contendere, reserving in writing
    the right to have an appellate court review an adverse
    determination of a specified pretrial motion. A de-
    fendant who prevails on appeal may then withdraw
    the plea.”
   The Government and the dissent argue that Rule
11(a)(2) means that “a defendant who pleads guilty cannot
challenge his conviction on appeal on a forfeitable or
waivable ground that he either failed to present to the
district court or failed to reserve in writing.” Brief for
United States 23; see also post, at 3–4, 17–18 (opinion of
ALITO, J.). They support this argument by pointing to the
notes of the Advisory Committee that drafted the text of
Rule 11(a)(2). See Advisory Committee’s Notes on 1983
Amendments to Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">18</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. App.,
p. 911 (hereinafter Advisory Committee’s Notes). In par-
ticular, the dissent points to the suggestion that an un-
conditional guilty plea constitutes a waiver of “nonjuris-
dictional defects,” while the Government points to the
drafters’ statement that they intended the Rule’s “condi-
tional plea procedure . . . to conserve prosecutorial and
judicial resources and advance speedy trial objectives,”
while ensuring “much needed uniformity in the federal
system on this matter.” Ibid.; see United States v. Vonn,
</pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""118487""><a href=""/opinion/118487/united-states-v-vonn/""><span class=""volume"">535</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">55</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 64, n. 6 (2002) (approving of Advisory Com-
mittee’s Notes as relevant evidence of the drafters’ intent).
The Government adds that its interpretation of the Rule
furthers these basic purposes. And, the argument goes,
just as defendants must use Rule 11(a)(2)’s procedures to
preserve, for instance, Fourth Amendment unlawful
search-and-seizure claims, so must they use it to preserve
the constitutional claims at issue here.
   The problem with this argument is that, by its own
10                CLASS v. UNITED STATES

                     Opinion of the Court

terms, the Rule itself does not say whether it sets forth the
exclusive procedure for a defendant to preserve a constitu-
tional claim following a guilty plea. At the same time, the
drafters’ notes acknowledge that the “Supreme Court has
held that certain kinds of constitutional objections may be
raised after a plea of guilty.” Advisory Committee’s Notes,
at 912. The notes then specifically refer to the “Menna-
Blackledge doctrine.” Ibid. They add that the Rule
“should not be interpreted as either broadening or narrow-
ing [that] doctrine or as establishing procedures for its
application.” Ibid. And the notes state that Rule 11(a)(2)
“has no application” to the “kinds of constitutional objec-
tions” that may be raised under that doctrine. Ibid. The
applicability of the Menna-Blackledge doctrine is at issue
in this case. Cf. Broce, 488 U. S., at 569 (acknowledging
Menna and Blackledge as covering claims “where on the
face of the record the court had no power to enter the
conviction or impose the sentence”). We therefore hold
that Rule 11(a)(2) cannot resolve this case.
   Third, the Government argues that Class “expressly
waived” his right to appeal his constitutional claim. Brief
for United States 15. The Government concedes that the
written plea agreement, which sets forth the “Complete
Agreement” between Class and the Government, see
App. 45–46, does not contain this waiver. Id., at 48–49.
Rather, the Government relies on the fact that during the
Rule 11 plea colloquy, the District Court Judge stated
that, under the written plea agreement, Class was “giving
up [his] right to appeal [his] conviction.” Id., at 76. And
Class agreed.
   We do not see why the District Court Judge’s statement
should bar Class’ constitutional claims. It was made to
ensure Class understood “the terms of any plea-agreement
provision waiving the right to appeal or to collaterally
attack the sentence.” Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11(b)(1)(N). It
does not expressly refer to a waiver of the appeal right
                 Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)                 11

                     Opinion of the Court

here at issue. And if it is interpreted as expressly includ-
ing that appeal right, it was wrong, as the Government
acknowledged at oral argument. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 35–
36. Under these circumstances, Class’ acquiescence nei-
ther expressly nor implicitly waived his right to appeal his
constitutional claims.
                        *    *     *
  For these reasons, we hold that Rodney Class may
pursue his constitutional claims on direct appeal. The
contrary judgment of the Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded
for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

                                                  It is so ordered.

  RODNEY CLASS, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES
 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

    APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT

                        [February 21, 2018]


   JUSTICE ALITO, with whom JUSTICE KENNEDY and
JUSTICE THOMAS join, dissenting.
   Roughly 95% of felony cases in the federal and state
courts are resolved by guilty pleas.1 Therefore it is criti-
cally important that defendants, prosecutors, and judges
understand the consequences of these pleas. In this case,
the parties have asked us to identify the claims that a
defendant can raise on appeal after entering an uncondi-
tional guilty plea. Regrettably, the Court provides no
clear answer.
   By my count, the Court identifies no fewer than five
rules for ascertaining the issues that can be raised. Ac-
cording to the Court, a defendant who pleads guilty may
assert on appeal (1) a claim that “implicates ‘the very
power of the State’ to prosecute [him],” ante, at 4, (2) a
claim that does not contradict the facts alleged in the
charging document, ante, at 5–6, (3) a claim that “ ‘the
facts alleged and admitted do not constitute a crime,’ ”
ante, at 5, and (4) claims other than “case-related constitu-
tional defects that ‘occurred prior to the entry of the guilty
plea,’ ” ante, at 6–7 (some internal quotation marks omit-

ted). In addition, the Court suggests (5) that such a de-
fendant may not be able to assert a claim that “contra-
dict[s] the terms of . . . [a] written plea agreement,” ante,
at 6, but whether this rule applies when the claim falls
into one of the prior four categories is left unclear. How
these rules fit together is anybody’s guess. And to make
matters worse, the Court also fails to make clear whether
its holding is based on the Constitution or some other
ground.
                              I
   There is no justification for the muddle left by today’s
decision. The question at issue is not conceptually com-
plex. In determining whether a plea of guilty prevents a
defendant in federal or state court from raising a particu-
lar issue on appeal, the first question is whether the Fed-
eral Constitution precludes waiver. If the Federal Consti-
tution permits waiver, the next question is whether some
other law nevertheless bars waiver. And if no law pre-
vents waiver, the final question is whether the defendant
knowingly and intelligently waived the right to raise the
claim on appeal. McMann v. Richardson, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""108138""><a href=""/opinion/108138/mcmann-v-richardson/""><span class=""volume"">397</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">759</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">,
766 (1970).
   Petitioner Rodney Class was charged with violating a
federal statute that forbids the carrying of firearms on the
grounds of the United States Capitol. See </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">40</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">.
§5104(e)(1). After entering an unconditional guilty plea,
he appealed his conviction, asserting that his conduct was
protected by the Second Amendment and that the statute
he violated is unconstitutionally vague. The Court of
Appeals affirmed his conviction, holding that Class had
relinquished his right to litigate these claims when he
entered his unconditional plea.
   Analyzing this case under the framework set out above,
I think the Court of Appeals was clearly correct. First, the
Federal Constitution does not prohibit the waiver of the
                     Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)                    3

                          ALITO, J., dissenting

rights Class asserts. We have held that most personal
constitutional rights may be waived, see, e.g., Peretz v.
United States, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""112645""><a href=""/opinion/112645/peretz-v-united-states/""><span class=""volume"">501</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">923</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 936–937 (1991), and Class
concedes that this is so with respect to the rights he is
asserting, Tr. of Oral Arg. 5, 18.
  Second, no federal statute or rule bars waiver. On the
contrary, Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Proce-
dure makes it clear that, with one exception that I will
discuss below, a defendant who enters an unconditional
plea waives all nonjurisdictional claims. Although the
Rule does not say this expressly, that is the unmistakable
implication of subdivision (a)(2), which allows a defendant,
“[w]ith the consent of the court and the government,” to
“enter a conditional plea of guilty or nolo contendere,
reserving in writing the right to have an appellate court
review an adverse determination of a specified pretrial
motion.” “Where [a law] explicitly enumerates certain
exceptions to a general prohibition, additional exceptions
are not to be implied, in the absence of evidence of a con-
trary . . . intent.” Andrus v. Glover Constr. Co., </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""110266""><a href=""/opinion/110266/andrus-v-glover-constr-co/""><span class=""volume"">446</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span>
<span class=""page"">608</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 616–617 (1980). And here, there is strong evidence
confirming that other exceptions were ruled out.
  The Advisory Committee’s Notes on Rule 11 make this
clear, stating that an unconditional plea (with the previ-
ously mentioned exception) “constitutes a waiver of all
nonjurisdictional defects.” Notes on 1983 Amendments, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">18</span>

against the backdrop of decisions of this Court holding
that a guilty plea generally relinquishes all defenses to
conviction, see, e.g., Tollett v. Henderson, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""108762""><a href=""/opinion/108762/tollett-v-henderson/""><span class=""volume"">411</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">258</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">,
267 (1973), and Rule 11(a)(2) creates a limited exception to
that general principle. Far from prohibiting the waiver of
nonjurisdictional claims, Rule 11 actually bars the raising
of such claims (once again, with the previously mentioned
exception).
  For now, I will skip over that exception and proceed to
the final question—whether Class voluntarily and intelli-
gently waived his right to raise his Second Amendment
and due process claims on appeal. It is not clear that he
raised this question in the Court of Appeals, and in any
event, this fact-specific inquiry is not within the scope of
the question of law on which we granted review: “Whether
a guilty plea inherently waives a defendant’s right to
challenge the constitutionality of his statute of conviction.”
Pet. for Cert. i. The Court does not decide the case on that
ground. Nor would I.

Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to
contest certain issues on appeal even if the defendant
entered an unconditional guilty plea. Since a rule of
procedure cannot abrogate a constitutional right, the
Advisory Committee’s Notes on Rule 11 specify that Rule
11(a)(2) “has no application” to the “Menna-Blackledge
doctrine” and “should not be interpreted as either broad-
ening or narrowing [that] doctrine or as establishing
procedures for its application.” Advisory Committee’s

  Because this doctrine is the only exception recognized in
Rule 11 and because the doctrine figures prominently in
the opinion of the Court, it is important to examine its
foundation and meaning.
                              B
  Blackledge and Menna represented marked departures
from our prior decisions. Before they were handed down,
our precedents were clear: When a defendant pleaded
guilty to a crime, he relinquished his right to litigate all
nonjurisdictional challenges to his conviction (except for
the claim that his plea was not voluntary and intelligent),
and the prosecution could assert this forfeiture to defeat a
subsequent appeal. The theory was easy to understand.
As we explained in Tollett, our view was that “a guilty plea
represents a break in the chain of events which has pre-
ceded it in the criminal process.” 411 U. S., at 267. The
defendant’s decision to plead guilty extinguished his right
to litigate whatever “possible defenses” or “constitutional
plea[s] in abatement” he might have pursued at trial or on
appeal. Id., at 267–268. Guilty pleas were understood to
have this effect because a guilty plea comprises both fac-
tual and legal concessions. Hence, we said in Tollett, a
defendant who pleads guilty is barred from contesting not
only the “historical facts” but also the “constitutional
significance” of those facts, even if he failed to “correctly
6                 CLASS v. UNITED STATES

                      ALITO, J., dissenting

apprais[e]” that significance at the time of his plea. Id., at
267 (emphasis added).
   When Tollett declared that a guilty plea encompasses all
legal and factual concessions necessary to authorize the
conviction, it was simply reiterating a principle we had
enunciated many times before, most recently in the so-
called “Brady trilogy.” See Brady v. United States, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""108137""><a href=""/opinion/108137/brady-v-united-states/""><span class=""volume"">397</span>
<span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">742</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 748 (1970) (“[T]he plea is more than an admis-
sion of past conduct; it is the defendant’s consent that
judgment of conviction may be entered”); McMann, 397
U. S., at 774 (a defendant who pleads guilty “assumes the
risk of ordinary error in either his or his attorney’s as-
sessment of the law and facts”); Parker v. North Carolina,
</pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""108139""><a href=""/opinion/108139/parker-v-north-carolina/""><span class=""volume"">397</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">790</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 797 (1970) (similar). As we put it in Boykin
v. Alabama, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""107951""><a href=""/opinion/107951/boykin-v-alabama/""><span class=""volume"">395</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">238</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 242 (1969), “[a] plea of guilty is
more than a confession which admits that the accused did
various acts; it is itself a conviction; nothing remains but
to give judgment and determine punishment.”
   On the strength of that rule, we held that defendants
who pleaded guilty forfeited a variety of important consti-
tutional claims. For instance, a defendant who pleaded
guilty could not attack his conviction on the ground that
the prosecution violated the Equal Protection Clause by
systematically excluding African-Americans from grand
juries in the county where he was indicted. Tollett, supra,
at 266. Nor could he argue that the prosecution unlawfully
coerced his confession—even if the confession was the only
evidence supporting the conviction. McMann, supra, at
768; Parker, supra, at 796–797. Nor could he assert that
his statute of conviction employed an unconstitutional
penalty provision; his consent to be punished under the
statute precluded this defense. Brady, supra, at 756–757.
Reflecting our general thinking, then-Judge Burger ex-
plained: “[I]f voluntarily and understandingly made, even
a layman should expect a plea of guilty to be treated as an
honest confession of guilt and a waiver of all defenses

omitted); see also A. Bishop, Waivers in Pleas of Guilty, 60
F. R. D. 513, 525–526 (1974) (summarizing the state of the
law on the eve of Blackledge: “All the bulwarks of the
fortress of defense are abandoned by the plea of guilty. . . .
The plea of guilty surrenders all defenses whatever and all
nonjurisdictional defects” (collecting cases)).
                            III
  Blackledge and Menna diverged from these prior prece-
dents, but neither case provided a clear or coherent expla-
nation for the departure.
                               A
  In Blackledge, the Court held that a defendant who
pleaded guilty could nevertheless challenge his conviction
on the ground that his right to due process was violated by
a vindictive prosecution. 417 U. S., at 30–31. The Court
asserted that this right was “markedly different” from the
equal protection and Fifth Amendment rights at stake in
Tollett and the Brady trilogy because it “went to the very
power of the State to bring the defendant into court to
answer the charge brought against him.” 417 U. S., at 30.
The meaning of this distinction, however, is hard to grasp.
  The most natural way to understand Blackledge’s refer-
ence to “the very power of the State” would be to say that
an argument survives a guilty plea if it attacks the court’s
jurisdiction. After all, that is usually what we mean when
we refer to the power to adjudicate. See, e.g., Arbaugh v.
Y & H Corp., </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""145677""><a href=""/opinion/145677/arbaugh-v-y-h-corp/""><span class=""volume"">546</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">500</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 514 (2006); United States v.
Cotton, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""118505""><a href=""/opinion/118505/united-states-v-cotton/""><span class=""volume"">535</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">625</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 630 (2002); Steel Co. v. Citizens for

cannot be what Blackledge meant.
  First, the defendant in Blackledge had been tried in
state court in North Carolina for a state-law offense, and
8                   CLASS v. UNITED STATES

                        ALITO, J., dissenting

the jurisdiction of state courts to entertain such prosecu-
tions is purely a matter of state law (unless Congress
validly and affirmatively ousts their jurisdiction—
something that had not happened in that case).3 Second, a
rule that jurisdictional defects alone survive a guilty plea
would not explain the result in Blackledge itself. Argu-
ments attacking a court’s subject-matter jurisdiction can
neither be waived nor forfeited. See, e.g., Wisconsin Dept.
of Corrections v. Schacht, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""118236""><a href=""/opinion/118236/wisconsin-dept-of-corrections-v-schacht/""><span class=""volume"">524</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">381</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 389 (1998); Miller
v. Roberts, 212 N. C. 126, 129, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""3657524""><a href=""/opinion/3911268/miller-v-roberts/""><span class=""volume"">193</span> <span class=""reporter"">S.E.</span> <span class=""page"">286</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 288 (1937).
But the due process right at issue in Blackledge was per-
fectly capable of being waived or forfeited—as is just about
every other right that is personal to a criminal defendant.
See, e.g., Peretz, 501 U. S., at 936–937.
   So if the “very power to prosecute” theory does not refer
to jurisdiction, what else might it mean? The only other
possibility that comes to mind is that it might mean that a
defendant can litigate a claim if it asserts a right not to be
tried, as opposed to a right not to be convicted. But we
have said that “virtually all rights of criminal defendants”
are “merely . . . right[s] not to be convicted,” as distin-
guished from “right[s] not to be tried.” Flanagan v. United
States, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""111099""><a href=""/opinion/111099/flanagan-v-united-states/""><span class=""volume"">465</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">259</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 267 (1984). Even when a constitu-
tional violation requires the dismissal of an indictment,
that “does not mean that [the] defendant enjoy[ed] a ‘right
not to be tried’ ” on the charges. United States v. Mac-
Donald, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""109838""><a href=""/opinion/109838/united-states-v-macdonald/""><span class=""volume"">435</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">850</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 860, n. 7 (1978).
   The rule could hardly be otherwise. Most constitutional
defenses (and plenty of statutory defenses), if successfully
asserted in a pretrial motion, deprive the prosecution of
the “power” to proceed to trial or secure a conviction. If
that remedial consequence converted them all into rights

not to be prosecuted, Blackledge would have no discernible
limit. “We have, after all, acknowledged that virtually
every right that could be enforced appropriately by pretrial
dismissal might loosely be described as conferring a ‘right
not to stand trial.’ ” Digital Equipment Corp. v. Desktop

Indeed, “all liti-
gants who have a meritorious pretrial claim for dismissal
can reasonably claim a right not to stand trial.” Van
Cauwenberghe v. Biard, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""112092""><a href=""/opinion/112092/van-cauwenberghe-v-biard/""><span class=""volume"">486</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">517</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 524 (1988).
  It is true that we have spoken of a distinction between a
right not to be tried and a right not to be convicted in one
context: when defining the scope of the collateral order
doctrine. E.g., Flanagan, supra, at 265–267. That is, we
have allowed defendants in federal criminal cases to take
an immediate appeal from the denial of a pretrial motion
when the right at issue is properly understood to be a
right not to be tried. A prime example is a case in which a
defendant claims that a prosecution would violate the
Double Jeopardy Clause. See Abney v. United States, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""109677""><a href=""/opinion/109677/abney-v-united-states/""><span class=""volume"">431</span>
<span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">651</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 662 (1977). Allowing an interlocutory appeal in
that situation protects against all the harms that flow
from the prolongation of a case that should never have
been brought. See id., at 661. But that rationale cannot
justify the Menna-Blackledge doctrine, because allowing a
defendant to appeal after a guilty plea does not cut short a
prosecution that should never have been brought. On the
contrary, it prolongs the litigation. So the distinction
drawn in our collateral order cases makes no sense in
distinguishing between the claims that should and the
claims that should not survive a guilty plea.
  Nor, in any event, would such a rule be consistent with
the decision in Blackledge, because we have held that an
unsuccessful vindictive prosecution claim may not be
appealed before trial. United States v. Hollywood Motor
Car Co., </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""110777""><a href=""/opinion/110777/united-states-v-hollywood-motor-car-co/""><span class=""volume"">458</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">263</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 264 (1982) ( per curiam). And none
of this would do any good for Class, for we have never
10                  CLASS v. UNITED STATES

                        ALITO, J., dissenting

permitted a defendant to appeal a pretrial order rejecting
a constitutional challenge to the statute the defendant
allegedly violated. In fact we have repudiated the very
suggestion. Id., at 270.
  The upshot is that the supposed “right not to be prose-
cuted” has no intelligible meaning in this context. And
Blackledge identified no basis for this new right in the text
of the Constitution or history or prior precedent. What is
more, it did all this without bothering to consider the
understanding of a guilty plea under the law of the State
where the Blackledge defendant was convicted or anything
that was said to him or that he said at the time of his plea.
                             B
   If the thinking behind Blackledge is hard to follow,
Menna may be worse. In that case, the Court held that a
defendant who pleaded guilty could challenge his convic-
tion on double jeopardy grounds. 423 U. S., at 62. The
case was decided by a three-page per curiam opinion, its
entire analysis confined to a single footnote. And the
footnote, rather than elucidating what was said in Black-
ledge, substituted a different rationale. Arguing that
Tollett and the other prior related cases did not preclude
appellate review of the double jeopardy claim, the Court
wrote:
       “[A] counseled plea of guilty is an admission of factual
       guilt so reliable that, where voluntary and intelligent,
       it quite validly removes the issue of factual guilt from
       the case. In most cases, factual guilt is a sufficient
       basis for the State’s imposition of punishment. A
       guilty plea, therefore, simply renders irrelevant those
       constitutional violations not logically inconsistent
       with the valid establishment of factual guilt.” Menna,
       423 U. S., at 62–63, n. 2.
     The wording of the final sentence is not easy to parse,
                  Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)           11

                      ALITO, J., dissenting

but I interpret the Court’s reasoning as follows: A defend-
ant who pleads guilty does no more than admit that he
committed the essential conduct charged in the indict-
ment; therefore a guilty plea allows the litigation on ap-
peal of any claim that is not inconsistent with the facts
that the defendant necessarily admitted. If that is the
correct meaning, the sentence would overrule many of the
cases that it purported to distinguish, including Tollett,
which involved an unconstitutional grand jury claim. It
would contradict much that the Court had previously said
about the effect of a guilty plea. See, e.g., Boykin, 395
U. S., at 242 (“A plea of guilty is more than a confession
which admits that the accused did various acts; it is itself
a conviction”). And it would permit a defendant who
pleads guilty to raise on appeal a whole host of claims,
including, for example, the denial of motions to suppress
evidence allegedly obtained in violation of the Fourth,
Fifth, or Sixth Amendments. See, e.g., Linkletter v. Walker,
</pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""107084""><a href=""/opinion/107084/linkletter-v-walker/""><span class=""volume"">381</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">618</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 638 (1965) (most Fourth Amendment claims
have “no bearing on guilt”). A holding of that scope is not
what one expects to see in a footnote in a per curiam opin-
ion, but if the Court meant less, its meaning is unclear.
                              C
  When the Court returned to Blackledge and Menna in
United States v. Broce, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""112177""><a href=""/opinion/112177/united-states-v-broce/""><span class=""volume"">488</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">563</span></a></span><pre class=""inline""> (1989), the Court
essentially repudiated the theories offered in those earlier
cases. (The Court terms this a “reaffirm[ation].” Ante, at
6.) Like Menna, Broce involved a defendant (actually two
defendants) who pleaded guilty but then sought to attack
their convictions on double jeopardy grounds. 488 U. S., at
565. This time, however, the Court held that their guilty
pleas prevented them from litigating their claims. Ibid.
  The Court began by specifically disavowing Menna’s
suggestion that a guilty plea admits only “ ‘factual guilt,’ ”
meaning “the acts described in the indictments.” Broce,
12                   CLASS v. UNITED STATES

                         ALITO, J., dissenting

488 U. S., at 568–569. Instead, the Court explained, an
unconditional guilty plea admits “all of the factual and
legal elements necessary to sustain a binding, final judg-
ment of guilt and a lawful sentence.” Id., at 569 (emphasis
added). “By entering a plea of guilty, the accused is not
simply stating that he did the discrete acts described in
the indictment; he is admitting guilt of a substantive
crime.” Id., at 570. Such “admissions,” Broce continued,
are “necessarily made upon entry of a voluntary plea of
guilty.” Id., at 573–574. And invoking Tollett, the Court
added that it makes no difference whether the defendant
“ ‘may not have correctly appraised the constitutional
significance of certain historical facts.’ ” 488 U. S., at 572
(quoting 411 U. S., at 267). Thus, the Court concluded, a
defendant’s decision to plead guilty necessarily extin-
guishes whatever “potential defense[s]” he might have
asserted in an effort to show that it would be unlawful to
hold him liable for his conduct. 488 U. S., at 573. So
much for Menna.
   As for Blackledge, by holding that the defendants’ dou-
ble jeopardy rights were extinguished by their pleas, Broce
necessarily rejected the idea that a right not to be tried
survives an unconditional guilty plea. See Abney, 431
U. S., at 662 (holding for collateral-order-doctrine purposes
that the Double Jeopardy Clause confers a right not to be
tried).
   While Broce thus rejected the reasoning in Blackledge
and Menna, the Court was content to distinguish those
cases on the ground that they involved defendants who
could succeed on appeal without going beyond “the exist-
ing record,” whereas the defendants in Broce would have
to present new evidence. Broce, supra, at 575.4
——————
  4 The majority asserts that, unlike the defendants in Broce, Class can

make out his constitutional arguments without needing to undertake
any factual development. Ante, at 6. It is difficult to see how that can

   This is where the Menna-Blackledge doctrine stood
when we heard this case. Now, instead of clarifying the
law, the Court sows new confusion by reiterating with
seeming approval a string of catchphrases. The Court
repeats the line that an argument survives if it “implicates
‘the very power of the State’ to prosecute the defendant,”
ante, at 4 (quoting Blackledge, 417 U. S., at 30), but this
shibboleth is no more intelligible now than it was when
first incanted in Blackledge. The Court also parrots the
rule set out in the Menna footnote—that the only argu-
ments waived by a guilty plea are those that contradict
the facts alleged in the charging document, see ante, at 5–
6, even though that rule is inconsistent with Tollett, the
Brady trilogy, and Broce—and even though this reading
——————
be true. Class’s Second Amendment argument is that banning firearms
in the Maryland Avenue parking lot of the Capitol Building goes too
far, at least as applied to him specifically. As his court-appointed
amicus presented it to the Court of Appeals, this argument depends on
Class’s own personal characteristics, including his record of mental
health and law abidingness, as well as characteristics specific to the
Maryland Avenue parking lot, including, inter alia, its distance from
the Capitol Building, the extent to which it is unsecured, the extent to
which it is publicly accessible, what business typically occurs there,
who regularly congregates there, and the nature of security screening
visitors must pass through upon entering. See Opening Brief of Court-
Appointed Amicus Curiae in Support of Appellant in No. 15–3015
(CADC), pp. 34–35, 41–45. Similarly, Class’s due process argument
requires an assessment of how difficult it would be for an average
person to determine that the Maryland Avenue lot is part of the Capitol
Grounds, which turns on the extent to which the lot is publicly acces-
sible, how heavily trafficked it is and by what types of vehicles, whether
there are signs indicating it is part of the Capitol Grounds or that guns
are prohibited and where such signs are located, and whether there are
security gates or checkpoints nearby. See id., at 51, 53. These argu-
ments require facts. I understand the majority opinion to preclude

                     ALITO, J., dissenting

would permit a defendant who pleads guilty to raise an
uncertain assortment of claims never before thought to
survive a guilty plea.
   For example, would this rule permit a defendant to
argue that his prosecution is barred by a statute of limita-
tions or by the Speedy Trial Act? Presumably the answer
is yes. By admitting commission of the acts alleged in an
indictment or complaint, a defendant would not concede
that the charge was timely. What about the argument
that a defendant’s alleged conduct does not violate the
statute of conviction? Here again, the rule barring only
those claims inconsistent with the facts alleged in the
indictment or complaint would appear to permit the issue
to be raised on appeal, but the Court says that a defendant
who pleads guilty “has admitted the charges against him.”
Ante, at 7. What does this mean, exactly? The majority is
coy, but “admit[ing] the charges against him” would ap-
pear to mean admitting that his conduct satisfies each
element of the statute he is charged with violating. It
must mean that because we have held that if a defendant
does not understand that he is admitting his conduct
satisfies each element of the crime, his guilty plea is in-
voluntary and unintelligent and therefore invalid. Hen-
derson v. Morgan, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""109492""><a href=""/opinion/109492/henderson-v-morgan/""><span class=""volume"">426</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">637</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 644–645 (1976). So if a
defendant who pleads guilty “admit[s] the charges against
him,” and if he does not claim that his plea was involun-
tary or unintelligent, his plea must be taken as an admis-
sion that he did everything the statute forbids.
   But if that is so, then what about the rule suggested by
the old Massachusetts opinion the Court touts? There,
Justice Ames wrote that a guilty plea does not waive the
right to argue that “ ‘the facts alleged and admitted do not
constitute a crime against the laws of the Common-
wealth.’ ” Ante, at 5 (quoting Commonwealth v. Hinds, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">101</span>
<span class=""reporter"">Mass.</span> <span class=""page"">209</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 210 (1869)). Does the Court agree with Justice
Ames, or not?

                      ALITO, J., dissenting

   Approaching the question from the opposite direction,
the Court says that a guilty plea precludes a defendant
from litigating “the constitutionality of case-related gov-
ernment conduct that takes place before the plea is en-
tered.” Ante, at 8. This category is most mysterious. I
thought Class was arguing that the Government violated
the Constitution at the moment when it initiated his
prosecution. That sounds like he is trying to attack “the
constitutionality of case-related government conduct that
[took] place before the plea [was] entered.” Yet the Court
holds that he may proceed. Why?
   Finally, the majority instructs that “a valid guilty plea
relinquishes any claim that would contradict the ‘admis-
sions necessarily made upon entry of a voluntary plea of
guilty.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Broce, 488 U. S., at 573–574). I
agree with that statement of the rule, but what the Court
fails to acknowledge is that the scope of this rule depends
on the law of the particular jurisdiction in question. If a
defendant in federal court is told that under Rule 11 an
unconditional guilty plea waives all nonjurisdictional
claims (or as Broce put it, admits “all of the factual and
legal elements necessary to sustain a binding, final judg-
ment of guilt and a lawful sentence,” id., at 569), then that
is the scope of the admissions implicit in the plea.
                             B
   Perhaps sensing the incoherence of its effort, the majority
seeks refuge in history, asserting that today’s holding
“flows directly from this Court’s prior decisions.” Ante, at
3. But this history cannot prop up the Court’s decision.
Start with Haynes v. United States, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""107608""><a href=""/opinion/107608/haynes-v-united-states/""><span class=""volume"">390</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">85</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 87, n. 2
(1968), in which the Court reached the merits of a defend-
ant’s constitutional challenge to his conviction despite the
fact that he had pleaded guilty. Ante, at 3–4. A moment’s
glance reveals that this decision is irrelevant for present
purposes (which presumably explains why it was not even
16                CLASS v. UNITED STATES

                      ALITO, J., dissenting

cited in Blackledge, Menna, Tollett, the Brady trilogy, or
Broce).
   In Haynes, the Government did not argue that the
defendant’s guilty plea barred him from pressing his
constitutional challenge on appeal. In fact, the Govern-
ment conceded that he would be entitled to relief if his
argument had merit. 390 U. S., at 100–101. No one has
suggested that a defendant’s guilty plea strips an appel-
late court of jurisdiction to entertain a constitutional
challenge to his conviction, so of course a reviewing court
need not dismiss an appeal sua sponte if the Government
does not assert the plea as a bar. But that tells us nothing
about what ought to happen when, as in this case, the
Government does argue that the defendant relinquished
his right to litigate his constitutional argument when he
opted to plead guilty.
   One must squint even harder to figure out why the
majority has dusted off Commonwealth v. Hinds, an 1869
decision of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts.
Ante, at 5. Hinds involved a state-law motion (“arrest of
judgment”) to set aside a conviction for a state-law crime
(common law forgery), in a state-court proceeding after the
defendant pleaded guilty. 101 Mass., at 210. One might
already be wondering what relevance the effect of a guilty
plea in state court, under state law, could have with re-
spect to the effect of a guilty plea in federal court, under
federal law. But in any event, what Hinds says about
guilty pleas is not helpful to Class at all. In Massachu-
setts at that time, motions to arrest a judgment could be
maintained only on the ground that the court that ren-
dered the judgment lacked jurisdiction. Mass. Gen. Stat.
§79 (1860); Commonwealth v. Eagan, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">103</span> <span class=""reporter"">Mass.</span> <span class=""page"">71</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 72
(1860); 3 F. Wharton, Criminal Law §3202, p. 177 (7th
rev. ed. 1874). And Massachusetts, like all the other
States, can define the jurisdiction of its courts as it pleases
(except insofar as federal law validly prevents).

                      ALITO, J., dissenting

   Thus, to the extent Hinds “reflect[s] an understanding
of the nature of guilty pleas,” ante, at 5, it reflects nothing
more than the idea that a defendant can assert jurisdic-
tional defects even after pleading guilty. That rule is
utterly unremarkable and of no help to Class. Today—as
well as at the time of the founding—federal courts have
jurisdiction over cases charging federal crimes. See </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">18</span>
<span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §3231; §9, 1 Stat. 76–77. And as early as 1830,
the Court rejected the suggestion that a federal court is
deprived of jurisdiction if “the indictment charges an
offence not punishable criminally according to the law of
the land.” Ex parte Watkins, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">3</span> <span class=""reporter"">Pet.</span> <span class=""page"">193</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 203. We have
repeatedly reaffirmed that proposition. See, e.g., Lamar v.

of jurisdiction even if “the indictment does not charge a
crime against the United States”); United States v. Wil-

ute is wholly unconstitutional, or . . . the facts stated in
the indictment do not constitute a crime”); Cotton, 535
U. S., at 630–631. And although a handful of our “post–
1867 cases” suggested that a criminal court lacked juris-
diction if “the statute under which [the defendant] had
been convicted was unconstitutional,” those suggestions
“reflected a ‘softening’ of the concept of jurisdiction” rather
than that concept’s originally understood—and modern—
meaning. Danforth v. Minnesota, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""145832""><a href=""/opinion/145832/danforth-v-minnesota/""><span class=""volume"">552</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">264</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 272, n. 6
(2008).
                        *     *    *
   In sum, the governing law in the present case is Rule 11
of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Under that
Rule, an unconditional guilty plea waives all nonjurisdic-
tional claims with the possible exception of the “Menna-
Blackledge doctrine” created years ago by this Court. That
doctrine is vacuous, has no sound foundation, and produces
nothing but confusion. At a minimum, I would limit the
18                CLASS v. UNITED STATES

                      ALITO, J., dissenting

doctrine to the particular types of claims involved in those
cases. I certainly would not expand its reach.
   I fear that today’s decision will bedevil the lower courts.
I respectfully dissent.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
          THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT

   No. 16–424.      Argued October 4, 2017—Decided February 21, 2018
A federal grand jury indicted petitioner, Rodney Class, for possessing
  firearms in his locked jeep, which was parked on the grounds of the
  United States Capitol in Washington, D. C.             See 40 U. S. C.
  §5104(e)(1) (“An individual . . . may not carry . . . on the Grounds or
  in any of the Capitol Buildings a firearm”). Appearing pro se, Class
  asked the District Court to dismiss the indictment. He alleged that
  the statute, §5104(e), violates the Second Amendment and the Due
  Process Clause. After the District Court dismissed both claims, Class
  pleaded guilty to “Possession of a Firearm on U. S. Capitol Grounds,
  in violation of 40 U. S. C. §5104(e).” App. 30. A written plea agree-
  ment set forth the terms of Class’ guilty plea, including several cate-
  gories of rights that he agreed to waive. The agreement said nothing
  about the right to challenge on direct appeal the constitutionality of
  the statute of conviction. After conducting a hearing pursuant to
  Rule 11(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the District
  Court accepted Class’ guilty plea and sentenced him. Soon thereaf-
  ter, Class sought to raise his constitutional claims on direct appeal.
  The Court of Appeals held that Class could not do so because, by
  pleading guilty, he had waived his constitutional claims.
Held: A guilty plea, by itself, does not bar a federal criminal defendant
 from challenging the constitutionality of his statute of conviction on
 direct appeal. Pp. 3–11.
    (a) This holding flows directly from this Court’s prior decisions.
 Fifty years ago, in Haynes v. United States, the Court addressed a
 similar claim challenging the constitutionality of a criminal statute.
 Justice Harlan’s opinion for the Court stated that the defendant’s
 “plea of guilty did not, of course, waive his previous [constitutional]
2                       CLASS v. UNITED STATES

                                  Syllabus

    claim.” 390 U. S. 85, 87, n. 2. That clear statement reflects an un-
    derstanding of the nature of guilty pleas that stretches, in broad out-
    line, nearly 150 years. Subsequent decisions have elaborated upon it.
    In Blackledge v. Perry, 417 U. S. 21, the Court recognized that a
    guilty plea bars some “ ‘antecedent constitutional violations,’ ” related
    to events (such as grand jury proceedings) that “ ‘occu[r] prior to the
    entry of the guilty plea.’ ” Id., at 30 (quoting Tollett v. Henderson,
    411 U. S. 258, 266–267). However, where the claim implicates “the
    very power of the State” to prosecute the defendant, a guilty plea
    cannot by itself bar it. 417 U. S., at 30. Likewise, in Menna v. New
    York, 423 U. S. 61, the Court held that because the defendant’s claim
    was that “the State may not convict [him] no matter how validly his
    factual guilt is established,” his “guilty plea, therefore, [did] not bar
    the claim.” Id., at 63, n. 2. In more recent years, the Court has reaf-
    firmed the Menna-Blackledge doctrine’s basic teaching that “ ‘a plea
    of guilty to a charge does not waive a claim that—judged on its face—
    the charge is one which the State may not constitutionally prose-
    cute.’ ” United States v. Broce, 488 U. S. 563, 575 (quoting Menna,
    supra, at 63, n. 2). Pp. 3–7.
       (b) In this case, Class neither expressly nor implicitly waived his
    constitutional claims by pleading guilty. As this Court understands
    them, the claims at issue here do not contradict the terms of the in-
    dictment or the written plea agreement and they can be resolved “on
    the basis of the existing record.” Broce, supra, at 575. Class chal-
    lenges the Government’s power to criminalize his (admitted) conduct
    and thereby calls into question the Government’s power to “ ‘constitu-
    tionally prosecute’ ” him. Ibid. (quoting Menna, supra, at 61–62, n.
    2). A guilty plea does not bar a direct appeal in these circumstances.
    Pp. 7–8.
       (c) Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(a)(2), which governs
    “conditional” guilty pleas, cannot resolve this case. By its own terms,
    the Rule does not say whether it sets forth the exclusive procedure
    for a defendant to preserve a constitutional claim following a guilty
    plea. And the Rule’s drafters acknowledged that the “Supreme Court
    has held that certain kinds of constitutional objections may be raised
    after a plea of guilty” and specifically stated that Rule 11(a)(2) “has
    no application” to the “kinds of constitutional objections” that may be
    raised under the “Menna-Blackledge doctrine.” Advisory Committee’s
    Notes on 1983 Amendments to Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11, 18 U. S. C.
    App., p. 912. Because the applicability of the Menna-Blackledge doc-
    trine is at issue here, Rule 11(a)(2) cannot resolve this case. Pp. 8–
    10.

  RODNEY CLASS, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES
 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

    APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT

                              [February 21, 2018]


  JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.
  Does a guilty plea bar a criminal defendant from later
appealing his conviction on the ground that the statute of
conviction violates the Constitution? In our view, a guilty
plea by itself does not bar that appeal.
                              I
   In September 2013, a federal grand jury indicted peti-
tioner, Rodney Class, for possessing firearms in his locked
jeep, which was parked in a lot on the grounds of the
United States Capitol in Washington, D. C. See 40
U. S. C. §5104(e)(1) (“An individual . . . may not carry . . .
on the Grounds or in any of the Capitol Buildings a fire-
arm”). Soon thereafter, Class, appearing pro se, asked the
Federal District Court for the District of Columbia to
dismiss the indictment. As relevant here, Class alleged
that the statute, §5104(e), violates the Second Amend-
ment. App. in No. 15–3015 (CADC), pp. 32–33. He also
raised a due process claim, arguing that he was denied
fair notice that weapons were banned in the parking lot.
Id., at 39. Following a hearing, the District Court denied
both claims. App. to Pet. for Cert. 9a.
   Several months later, Class pleaded guilty to “Posses-
2                 CLASS v. UNITED STATES

                     Opinion of the Court

sion of a Firearm on U. S. Capitol Grounds, in violation of
40 U. S. C. §5104(e).” App. 30. The Government agreed to
drop related charges. Id., at 31.
   A written plea agreement set forth the terms of Class’
guilty plea, including several categories of rights that he
expressly agreed to waive. Those express waivers included:
(1) all defenses based upon the statute of limitations;
(2) several specified trial rights; (3) the right to appeal a
sentence at or below the judicially determined, maximum
sentencing guideline range; (4) most collateral attacks on
the conviction and sentence; and (5) various rights to
request or receive information concerning the investiga-
tion and prosecution of his criminal case. Id., at 38–42.
At the same time, the plea agreement expressly enumer-
ated categories of claims that Class could raise on appeal,
including claims based upon (1) newly discovered evi-
dence; (2) ineffective assistance of counsel; and (3) certain
statutes providing for sentence reductions. Id., at 41.
Finally, the plea agreement stated under the heading
“Complete Agreement”:
    “No agreements, promises, understandings, or repre-
    sentations have been made by the parties or their
    counsel other than those contained in writing herein,
    nor will any such agreements . . . be made unless
    committed to writing and signed . . . .” Id., at 45.
The agreement said nothing about the right to raise on
direct appeal a claim that the statute of conviction was
unconstitutional.
    The District Court held a plea hearing during which it
reviewed the terms of the plea agreement (with Class
present and under oath) to ensure the validity of the plea.
See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11(b); United States v. Ruiz, 536
U. S. 622, 629 (2002) (defendant’s guilty plea must be
“ ‘voluntary’ ” and “related waivers” must be made “ ‘know-
ing[ly], intelligent[ly], [and] with sufficient awareness of
                  Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)            3

                      Opinion of the Court

the relevant circumstances and likely consequences’ ”).
After providing Class with the required information and
warnings, the District Court accepted his guilty plea.
Class was sentenced to 24 days imprisonment followed by
12 months of supervised release.
  Several days later, Class appealed his conviction to the
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Class was appointed an amicus to aid him in presenting
his arguments. He repeated his constitutional claims,
namely, that the statute violates the Second Amendment
and the Due Process Clause because it fails to give fair
notice of which areas fall within the Capitol Grounds
where firearms are banned. The Court of Appeals held
that Class could not raise his constitutional claims be-
cause, by pleading guilty, he had waived them. App. to
Pet. for Cert. 1a–5a. Class filed a petition for certiorari in
this Court asking us to decide whether in pleading guilty a
criminal defendant inherently waives the right to chal-
lenge the constitutionality of his statute of conviction. We
agreed to do so.
                              II
   The question is whether a guilty plea by itself bars a
federal criminal defendant from challenging the constitu-
tionality of the statute of conviction on direct appeal. We
hold that it does not. Class did not relinquish his right to
appeal the District Court’s constitutional determinations
simply by pleading guilty. As we shall explain, this hold-
ing flows directly from this Court’s prior decisions.
   Fifty years ago this Court directly addressed a similar
claim (a claim that the statute of conviction was unconsti-
tutional). And the Court stated that a defendant’s “plea of
guilty did not . . . waive his previous [constitutional]
claim.” Haynes v. United States, 390 U. S. 85, 87, n. 2
(1968). Though Justice Harlan’s opinion for the Court in
Haynes offered little explanation for this statement, sub-
4                 CLASS v. UNITED STATES

                      Opinion of the Court

sequent decisions offered a rationale that applies here.
   In Blackledge v. Perry, 417 U. S. 21 (1974), North Caro-
lina indicted and convicted Jimmy Seth Perry on a mis-
demeanor assault charge. When Perry exercised his right
under a North Carolina statute to a de novo trial in a
higher court, the State reindicted him, but this time the
State charged a felony, which carried a heavier penalty,
for the same conduct. Perry pleaded guilty. He then
sought habeas relief on the grounds that the reindictment
amounted to an unconstitutional vindictive prosecution.
The State argued that Perry’s guilty plea barred him from
raising his constitutional challenge. But this Court held
that it did not.
   The Court noted that a guilty plea bars appeal of many
claims, including some “ ‘antecedent constitutional viola-
tions’ ” related to events (say, grand jury proceedings) that
had “ ‘occurred prior to the entry of the guilty plea.’ ” Id.,
at 30 (quoting Tollett v. Henderson, 411 U. S. 258, 266–
267 (1973)). While Tollett claims were “of constitutional
dimension,” the Court explained that “the nature of the
underlying constitutional infirmity is markedly different”
from a claim of vindictive prosecution, which implicates
“the very power of the State” to prosecute the defendant.
Blackledge, 417 U. S., at 30. Accordingly, the Court wrote
that “the right” Perry “asserts and that we today accept is
the right not to be haled into court at all upon the felony
charge” since “[t]he very initiation of the proceedings”
against Perry “operated to deprive him due process of
law.” Id., at 30–31.
   A year and a half later, in Menna v. New York, 423 U. S.
61 (1975) (per curiam), this Court repeated what it had
said and held in Blackledge. After Menna served a 30-day
jail term for refusing to testify before the grand jury on
November 7, 1968, the State of New York charged him
once again for (what Menna argued was) the same crime.
Menna pleaded guilty, but subsequently appealed arguing

                     Opinion of the Court

that the new charge violated the Double Jeopardy Clause.
U. S. Const., Amdt. 5. The lower courts held that Menna’s
constitutional claim had been “waived” by his guilty plea.
  This Court reversed. Citing Blackledge, supra, at 30,
the Court held that “a plea of guilty to a charge does not
waive a claim that—judged on its face—the charge is one
which the State may not constitutionally prosecute.”
Menna, 423 U. S., at 63, and n. 2. Menna’s claim amounted
to a claim that “the State may not convict” him “no
matter how validly his factual guilt is established.” Ibid.
Menna’s “guilty plea, therefore, [did] not bar the claim.”
Ibid.
  These holdings reflect an understanding of the nature of
guilty pleas which, in broad outline, stretches back nearly
150 years. In 1869 Justice Ames wrote for the Supreme
Judicial Court of Massachusetts:
    “The plea of guilty is, of course, a confession of all the
    facts charged in the indictment, and also of the evil
    intent imputed to the defendant. It is a waiver also of
    all merely technical and formal objections of which the
    defendant could have availed himself by any other
    plea or motion. But if the facts alleged and admitted
    do not constitute a crime against the laws of the
    Commonwealth, the defendant is entitled to be dis-
    charged.” Commonwealth v. Hinds, 101 Mass. 209,
    210.
   Decisions of federal and state courts throughout the
19th and 20th centuries reflect a similar view of the na-
ture of a guilty plea. See United States v. Ury, 106 F. 2d
28 (CA2 1939) (holding the “plea of guilty did not foreclose
the appellant,” who argued that a statute was unconstitu-
tional, “from the review he now seeks” (citing earlier
cases)); Hocking Valley R. Co. v. United States, 210 F. 735
(CA6 1914) (holding that a defendant may raise the claim
that, because the indictment did not charge an offense no
6                 CLASS v. UNITED STATES

                     Opinion of the Court

crime has been committed, for it is “the settled rule that,”
despite a guilty plea, a defendant “may urge” such a con-
tention “in the reviewing court”); Carper v. State, 27 Ohio
St. 572, 575 (1875) (same). We refer to these cases be-
cause it was against this background that Justice Harlan
in his opinion for the Court made the statement to which
we originally referred, namely, that a defendant’s “plea of
guilty did not, of course, waive his previous [constitution-
al] claim.” Haynes, 390 U. S., at 87, n. 2 (citing Ury, su-
pra, at 28).
   In more recent years, we have reaffirmed the Menna-
Blackledge doctrine and refined its scope. In United States
v. Broce, 488 U. S. 563 (1989), the defendants pleaded
guilty to two separate indictments in a single proceeding
which “on their face” described two separate bid-rigging
conspiracies. Id., at 576. They later sought to challenge
their convictions on double jeopardy grounds, arguing that
they had only admitted to one conspiracy. Citing Black-
ledge and Menna, this Court repeated that a guilty plea
does not bar a claim on appeal “where on the face of the
record the court had no power to enter the conviction or
impose the sentence.” 488 U. S., at 569. However, be-
cause the defendants could not “prove their claim by rely-
ing on those indictments and the existing record” and
“without contradicting those indictments,” this Court held
that their claims were “foreclosed by the admissions in-
herent in their guilty pleas.” Id., at 576.
   Unlike the claims in Broce, Class’ constitutional claims
here, as we understand them, do not contradict the terms
of the indictment or the written plea agreement. They are
consistent with Class’ knowing, voluntary, and intelligent
admission that he did what the indictment alleged. Those
claims can be “resolved without any need to venture be-
yond that record.” Id., at 575.
   Nor do Class’ claims focus upon case-related constitu-
tional defects that “ ‘occurred prior to the entry of the
                  Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)            7

                      Opinion of the Court

guilty plea.’ ” Blackledge, 417 U. S., at 30. They could not,
for example, “have been ‘cured’ through a new indictment
by a properly selected grand jury.” Ibid. (citing Tollett,
411 U. S., at 267). Because the defendant has admitted
the charges against him, a guilty plea makes the latter
kind of constitutional claim “irrelevant to the constitu-
tional validity of the conviction.” Haring v. Prosise, 462
U. S. 306, 321 (1983). But the cases to which we have
referred make clear that a defendant’s guilty plea does not
make irrelevant the kind of constitutional claim Class
seeks to make.
    In sum, the claims at issue here do not fall within any of
the categories of claims that Class’ plea agreement forbids
him to raise on direct appeal. They challenge the Gov-
ernment’s power to criminalize Class’ (admitted) conduct.
They thereby call into question the Government’s power to
“ ‘constitutionally prosecute’ ” him. Broce, supra, at 575
(quoting Menna, supra, at 61–62, n. 2). A guilty plea does
not bar a direct appeal in these circumstances.
                              III
   We are not convinced by the three basic arguments that
the Government and the dissent make in reply.
   First, the Government contends that by entering a
guilty plea, Class inherently relinquished his constitu-
tional claims. The Government is correct that a guilty
plea does implicitly waive some claims, including some
constitutional claims. However, as we explained in Part
II, supra, Class’ valid guilty plea does not, by itself,
bar direct appeal of his constitutional claims in these
circumstances.
   As an initial matter, a valid guilty plea “forgoes not only
a fair trial, but also other accompanying constitutional
guarantees.” Ruiz, 536 U. S., at 628–629. While those
“simultaneously” relinquished rights include the privilege
against compulsory self-incrimination, the jury trial right,
8                 CLASS v. UNITED STATES

                      Opinion of the Court

and the right to confront accusers, McCarthy v. United
States, 394 U. S. 459, 466 (1969), they do not include “a
waiver of the privileges which exist beyond the confines of
the trial.” Mitchell v. United States, 526 U. S. 314, 324
(1999). Here, Class’ statutory right directly to appeal his
conviction “cannot in any way be characterized as part of
the trial.” Lafler v. Cooper, 566 U. S. 156, 165 (2012).
   A valid guilty plea also renders irrelevant—and thereby
prevents the defendant from appealing—the constitution-
ality of case-related government conduct that takes place
before the plea is entered. See, e.g., Haring, supra, at 320
(holding a valid guilty plea “results in the defendant’s loss
of any meaningful opportunity he might otherwise have
had to challenge the admissibility of evidence obtained in
violation of the Fourth Amendment”). Neither can the
defendant later complain that the indicting grand jury
was unconstitutionally selected. Tollett, supra, at 266.
But, as we have said, those kinds of claims are not at issue
here.
   Finally, a valid guilty plea relinquishes any claim that
would contradict the “admissions necessarily made upon
entry of a voluntary plea of guilty.” Broce, supra, at 573–
574. But the constitutional claim at issue here is con-
sistent with Class’ admission that he engaged in the con-
duct alleged in the indictment. Unlike the defendants in
Broce, Class’ challenge does not in any way deny that he
engaged in the conduct to which he admitted. Instead,
like the defendants in Blackledge and Menna, he seeks to
raise a claim which, “ ‘judged on its face’ ” based upon the
existing record, would extinguish the government’s power
to “ ‘constitutionally prosecute’ ” the defendant if the claim
were successful. Broce, supra, at 575 (quoting Menna, 423
U. S., at 62–63, and n. 2).
   Second, the Government and the dissent point to Rule
11(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which
governs “conditional” guilty pleas. The Rule states:
                 Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)            9

                     Opinion of the Court

    “Conditional Plea. With the consent of the court and
    the government, a defendant may enter a conditional
    plea of guilty or nolo contendere, reserving in writing
    the right to have an appellate court review an adverse
    determination of a specified pretrial motion. A de-
    fendant who prevails on appeal may then withdraw
    the plea.”
   The Government and the dissent argue that Rule
11(a)(2) means that “a defendant who pleads guilty cannot
challenge his conviction on appeal on a forfeitable or
waivable ground that he either failed to present to the
district court or failed to reserve in writing.” Brief for
United States 23; see also post, at 3–4, 17–18 (opinion of
ALITO, J.). They support this argument by pointing to the
notes of the Advisory Committee that drafted the text of
Rule 11(a)(2). See Advisory Committee’s Notes on 1983
Amendments to Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11, 18 U. S. C. App.,
p. 911 (hereinafter Advisory Committee’s Notes). In par-
ticular, the dissent points to the suggestion that an un-
conditional guilty plea constitutes a waiver of “nonjuris-
dictional defects,” while the Government points to the
drafters’ statement that they intended the Rule’s “condi-
tional plea procedure . . . to conserve prosecutorial and
judicial resources and advance speedy trial objectives,”
while ensuring “much needed uniformity in the federal
system on this matter.” Ibid.; see United States v. Vonn,
535 U. S. 55, 64, n. 6 (2002) (approving of Advisory Com-
mittee’s Notes as relevant evidence of the drafters’ intent).
The Government adds that its interpretation of the Rule
furthers these basic purposes. And, the argument goes,
just as defendants must use Rule 11(a)(2)’s procedures to
preserve, for instance, Fourth Amendment unlawful
search-and-seizure claims, so must they use it to preserve
the constitutional claims at issue here.
   The problem with this argument is that, by its own
10                CLASS v. UNITED STATES

                     Opinion of the Court

terms, the Rule itself does not say whether it sets forth the
exclusive procedure for a defendant to preserve a constitu-
tional claim following a guilty plea. At the same time, the
drafters’ notes acknowledge that the “Supreme Court has
held that certain kinds of constitutional objections may be
raised after a plea of guilty.” Advisory Committee’s Notes,
at 912. The notes then specifically refer to the “Menna-
Blackledge doctrine.” Ibid. They add that the Rule
“should not be interpreted as either broadening or narrow-
ing [that] doctrine or as establishing procedures for its
application.” Ibid. And the notes state that Rule 11(a)(2)
“has no application” to the “kinds of constitutional objec-
tions” that may be raised under that doctrine. Ibid. The
applicability of the Menna-Blackledge doctrine is at issue
in this case. Cf. Broce, 488 U. S., at 569 (acknowledging
Menna and Blackledge as covering claims “where on the
face of the record the court had no power to enter the
conviction or impose the sentence”). We therefore hold
that Rule 11(a)(2) cannot resolve this case.
   Third, the Government argues that Class “expressly
waived” his right to appeal his constitutional claim. Brief
for United States 15. The Government concedes that the
written plea agreement, which sets forth the “Complete
Agreement” between Class and the Government, see
App. 45–46, does not contain this waiver. Id., at 48–49.
Rather, the Government relies on the fact that during the
Rule 11 plea colloquy, the District Court Judge stated
that, under the written plea agreement, Class was “giving
up [his] right to appeal [his] conviction.” Id., at 76. And
Class agreed.
   We do not see why the District Court Judge’s statement
should bar Class’ constitutional claims. It was made to
ensure Class understood “the terms of any plea-agreement
provision waiving the right to appeal or to collaterally
attack the sentence.” Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11(b)(1)(N). It
does not expressly refer to a waiver of the appeal right
                 Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)                 11

                     Opinion of the Court

here at issue. And if it is interpreted as expressly includ-
ing that appeal right, it was wrong, as the Government
acknowledged at oral argument. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 35–
36. Under these circumstances, Class’ acquiescence nei-
ther expressly nor implicitly waived his right to appeal his
constitutional claims.
                        *    *     *
  For these reasons, we hold that Rodney Class may
pursue his constitutional claims on direct appeal. The
contrary judgment of the Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded
for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

                                                  It is so ordered.

  RODNEY CLASS, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES
 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

    APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT

                        [February 21, 2018]


   JUSTICE ALITO, with whom JUSTICE KENNEDY and
JUSTICE THOMAS join, dissenting.
   Roughly 95% of felony cases in the federal and state
courts are resolved by guilty pleas.1 Therefore it is criti-
cally important that defendants, prosecutors, and judges
understand the consequences of these pleas. In this case,
the parties have asked us to identify the claims that a
defendant can raise on appeal after entering an uncondi-
tional guilty plea. Regrettably, the Court provides no
clear answer.
   By my count, the Court identifies no fewer than five
rules for ascertaining the issues that can be raised. Ac-
cording to the Court, a defendant who pleads guilty may
assert on appeal (1) a claim that “implicates ‘the very
power of the State’ to prosecute [him],” ante, at 4, (2) a
claim that does not contradict the facts alleged in the
charging document, ante, at 5–6, (3) a claim that “ ‘the
facts alleged and admitted do not constitute a crime,’ ”
ante, at 5, and (4) claims other than “case-related constitu-
tional defects that ‘occurred prior to the entry of the guilty
plea,’ ” ante, at 6–7 (some internal quotation marks omit-

ted). In addition, the Court suggests (5) that such a de-
fendant may not be able to assert a claim that “contra-
dict[s] the terms of . . . [a] written plea agreement,” ante,
at 6, but whether this rule applies when the claim falls
into one of the prior four categories is left unclear. How
these rules fit together is anybody’s guess. And to make
matters worse, the Court also fails to make clear whether
its holding is based on the Constitution or some other
ground.
                              I
   There is no justification for the muddle left by today’s
decision. The question at issue is not conceptually com-
plex. In determining whether a plea of guilty prevents a
defendant in federal or state court from raising a particu-
lar issue on appeal, the first question is whether the Fed-
eral Constitution precludes waiver. If the Federal Consti-
tution permits waiver, the next question is whether some
other law nevertheless bars waiver. And if no law pre-
vents waiver, the final question is whether the defendant
knowingly and intelligently waived the right to raise the
claim on appeal. McMann v. Richardson, 397 U. S. 759,
766 (1970).
   Petitioner Rodney Class was charged with violating a
federal statute that forbids the carrying of firearms on the
grounds of the United States Capitol. See 40 U. S. C.
§5104(e)(1). After entering an unconditional guilty plea,
he appealed his conviction, asserting that his conduct was
protected by the Second Amendment and that the statute
he violated is unconstitutionally vague. The Court of
Appeals affirmed his conviction, holding that Class had
relinquished his right to litigate these claims when he
entered his unconditional plea.
   Analyzing this case under the framework set out above,
I think the Court of Appeals was clearly correct. First, the
Federal Constitution does not prohibit the waiver of the
                     Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)                    3

                          ALITO, J., dissenting

rights Class asserts. We have held that most personal
constitutional rights may be waived, see, e.g., Peretz v.
United States, 501 U. S. 923, 936–937 (1991), and Class
concedes that this is so with respect to the rights he is
asserting, Tr. of Oral Arg. 5, 18.
  Second, no federal statute or rule bars waiver. On the
contrary, Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Proce-
dure makes it clear that, with one exception that I will
discuss below, a defendant who enters an unconditional
plea waives all nonjurisdictional claims. Although the
Rule does not say this expressly, that is the unmistakable
implication of subdivision (a)(2), which allows a defendant,
“[w]ith the consent of the court and the government,” to
“enter a conditional plea of guilty or nolo contendere,
reserving in writing the right to have an appellate court
review an adverse determination of a specified pretrial
motion.” “Where [a law] explicitly enumerates certain
exceptions to a general prohibition, additional exceptions
are not to be implied, in the absence of evidence of a con-
trary . . . intent.” Andrus v. Glover Constr. Co., 446 U. S.
608, 616–617 (1980). And here, there is strong evidence
confirming that other exceptions were ruled out.
  The Advisory Committee’s Notes on Rule 11 make this
clear, stating that an unconditional plea (with the previ-
ously mentioned exception) “constitutes a waiver of all
nonjurisdictional defects.” Notes on 1983 Amendments, 18
U. S. C. App., p. 911. Advisory Committee’s Notes on a
federal rule of procedure “provide a reliable source of
insight into the meaning of a rule, especially when, as
here, the rule was enacted precisely as the Advisory
Committee proposed.” United States v. Vonn, 535 U. S.
55, 64, n. 6 (2002).2 Subdivision (a)(2) was adopted

4                    CLASS v. UNITED STATES

                         ALITO, J., dissenting

against the backdrop of decisions of this Court holding
that a guilty plea generally relinquishes all defenses to
conviction, see, e.g., Tollett v. Henderson, 411 U. S. 258,
267 (1973), and Rule 11(a)(2) creates a limited exception to
that general principle. Far from prohibiting the waiver of
nonjurisdictional claims, Rule 11 actually bars the raising
of such claims (once again, with the previously mentioned
exception).
  For now, I will skip over that exception and proceed to
the final question—whether Class voluntarily and intelli-
gently waived his right to raise his Second Amendment
and due process claims on appeal. It is not clear that he
raised this question in the Court of Appeals, and in any
event, this fact-specific inquiry is not within the scope of
the question of law on which we granted review: “Whether
a guilty plea inherently waives a defendant’s right to
challenge the constitutionality of his statute of conviction.”
Pet. for Cert. i. The Court does not decide the case on that
ground. Nor would I.

  I now turn to the one exception mentioned in the Advi-
sory Committee’s Notes on Rule 11—what the Notes,
rather grandly, term the “Menna-Blackledge doctrine.”
Advisory Committee’s Notes, 18 U. S. C. App., at 912.
This “doctrine” consists of Blackledge v. Perry, 417 U. S.
21 (1974), a thinly reasoned decision handed down 44
years ago, and Menna v. New York, 423 U. S. 61 (1975)
(per curiam), a per curiam decision issued the next year.

Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to
contest certain issues on appeal even if the defendant
entered an unconditional guilty plea. Since a rule of
procedure cannot abrogate a constitutional right, the
Advisory Committee’s Notes on Rule 11 specify that Rule
11(a)(2) “has no application” to the “Menna-Blackledge
doctrine” and “should not be interpreted as either broad-
ening or narrowing [that] doctrine or as establishing
procedures for its application.” Advisory Committee’s
Notes, 18 U. S. C. App., at 912.
  Because this doctrine is the only exception recognized in
Rule 11 and because the doctrine figures prominently in
the opinion of the Court, it is important to examine its
foundation and meaning.
                              B
  Blackledge and Menna represented marked departures
from our prior decisions. Before they were handed down,
our precedents were clear: When a defendant pleaded
guilty to a crime, he relinquished his right to litigate all
nonjurisdictional challenges to his conviction (except for
the claim that his plea was not voluntary and intelligent),
and the prosecution could assert this forfeiture to defeat a
subsequent appeal. The theory was easy to understand.
As we explained in Tollett, our view was that “a guilty plea
represents a break in the chain of events which has pre-
ceded it in the criminal process.” 411 U. S., at 267. The
defendant’s decision to plead guilty extinguished his right
to litigate whatever “possible defenses” or “constitutional
plea[s] in abatement” he might have pursued at trial or on
appeal. Id., at 267–268. Guilty pleas were understood to
have this effect because a guilty plea comprises both fac-
tual and legal concessions. Hence, we said in Tollett, a
defendant who pleads guilty is barred from contesting not
only the “historical facts” but also the “constitutional
significance” of those facts, even if he failed to “correctly
6                 CLASS v. UNITED STATES

                      ALITO, J., dissenting

apprais[e]” that significance at the time of his plea. Id., at
267 (emphasis added).
   When Tollett declared that a guilty plea encompasses all
legal and factual concessions necessary to authorize the
conviction, it was simply reiterating a principle we had
enunciated many times before, most recently in the so-
called “Brady trilogy.” See Brady v. United States, 397
U. S. 742, 748 (1970) (“[T]he plea is more than an admis-
sion of past conduct; it is the defendant’s consent that
judgment of conviction may be entered”); McMann, 397
U. S., at 774 (a defendant who pleads guilty “assumes the
risk of ordinary error in either his or his attorney’s as-
sessment of the law and facts”); Parker v. North Carolina,
397 U. S. 790, 797 (1970) (similar). As we put it in Boykin
v. Alabama, 395 U. S. 238, 242 (1969), “[a] plea of guilty is
more than a confession which admits that the accused did
various acts; it is itself a conviction; nothing remains but
to give judgment and determine punishment.”
   On the strength of that rule, we held that defendants
who pleaded guilty forfeited a variety of important consti-
tutional claims. For instance, a defendant who pleaded
guilty could not attack his conviction on the ground that
the prosecution violated the Equal Protection Clause by
systematically excluding African-Americans from grand
juries in the county where he was indicted. Tollett, supra,
at 266. Nor could he argue that the prosecution unlawfully
coerced his confession—even if the confession was the only
evidence supporting the conviction. McMann, supra, at
768; Parker, supra, at 796–797. Nor could he assert that
his statute of conviction employed an unconstitutional
penalty provision; his consent to be punished under the
statute precluded this defense. Brady, supra, at 756–757.
Reflecting our general thinking, then-Judge Burger ex-
plained: “[I]f voluntarily and understandingly made, even
a layman should expect a plea of guilty to be treated as an
honest confession of guilt and a waiver of all defenses

known and unknown. And such is the law.” Edwards v.
United States, 256 F. 2d 707, 709 (CADC 1958) (footnote
omitted); see also A. Bishop, Waivers in Pleas of Guilty, 60
F. R. D. 513, 525–526 (1974) (summarizing the state of the
law on the eve of Blackledge: “All the bulwarks of the
fortress of defense are abandoned by the plea of guilty. . . .
The plea of guilty surrenders all defenses whatever and all
nonjurisdictional defects” (collecting cases)).
                            III
  Blackledge and Menna diverged from these prior prece-
dents, but neither case provided a clear or coherent expla-
nation for the departure.
                               A
  In Blackledge, the Court held that a defendant who
pleaded guilty could nevertheless challenge his conviction
on the ground that his right to due process was violated by
a vindictive prosecution. 417 U. S., at 30–31. The Court
asserted that this right was “markedly different” from the
equal protection and Fifth Amendment rights at stake in
Tollett and the Brady trilogy because it “went to the very
power of the State to bring the defendant into court to
answer the charge brought against him.” 417 U. S., at 30.
The meaning of this distinction, however, is hard to grasp.
  The most natural way to understand Blackledge’s refer-
ence to “the very power of the State” would be to say that
an argument survives a guilty plea if it attacks the court’s
jurisdiction. After all, that is usually what we mean when
we refer to the power to adjudicate. See, e.g., Arbaugh v.
Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, 514 (2006); United States v.
Cotton, 535 U. S. 625, 630 (2002); Steel Co. v. Citizens for
Better Environment, 523 U. S. 83, 89 (1998). But that
cannot be what Blackledge meant.
  First, the defendant in Blackledge had been tried in
state court in North Carolina for a state-law offense, and
8                   CLASS v. UNITED STATES

                        ALITO, J., dissenting

the jurisdiction of state courts to entertain such prosecu-
tions is purely a matter of state law (unless Congress
validly and affirmatively ousts their jurisdiction—
something that had not happened in that case).3 Second, a
rule that jurisdictional defects alone survive a guilty plea
would not explain the result in Blackledge itself. Argu-
ments attacking a court’s subject-matter jurisdiction can
neither be waived nor forfeited. See, e.g., Wisconsin Dept.
of Corrections v. Schacht, 524 U. S. 381, 389 (1998); Miller
v. Roberts, 212 N. C. 126, 129, 193 S. E. 286, 288 (1937).
But the due process right at issue in Blackledge was per-
fectly capable of being waived or forfeited—as is just about
every other right that is personal to a criminal defendant.
See, e.g., Peretz, 501 U. S., at 936–937.
   So if the “very power to prosecute” theory does not refer
to jurisdiction, what else might it mean? The only other
possibility that comes to mind is that it might mean that a
defendant can litigate a claim if it asserts a right not to be
tried, as opposed to a right not to be convicted. But we
have said that “virtually all rights of criminal defendants”
are “merely . . . right[s] not to be convicted,” as distin-
guished from “right[s] not to be tried.” Flanagan v. United
States, 465 U. S. 259, 267 (1984). Even when a constitu-
tional violation requires the dismissal of an indictment,
that “does not mean that [the] defendant enjoy[ed] a ‘right
not to be tried’ ” on the charges. United States v. Mac-
Donald, 435 U. S. 850, 860, n. 7 (1978).
   The rule could hardly be otherwise. Most constitutional
defenses (and plenty of statutory defenses), if successfully
asserted in a pretrial motion, deprive the prosecution of
the “power” to proceed to trial or secure a conviction. If
that remedial consequence converted them all into rights
——————
  3 Even for cases prosecuted in federal court, an alleged vindictive

prosecution does not present a jurisdictional defect. See 18 U. S. C.
§3231.
                 Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)           9

                     ALITO, J., dissenting

not to be prosecuted, Blackledge would have no discernible
limit. “We have, after all, acknowledged that virtually
every right that could be enforced appropriately by pretrial
dismissal might loosely be described as conferring a ‘right
not to stand trial.’ ” Digital Equipment Corp. v. Desktop
Direct, Inc., 511 U. S. 863, 873 (1994). Indeed, “all liti-
gants who have a meritorious pretrial claim for dismissal
can reasonably claim a right not to stand trial.” Van
Cauwenberghe v. Biard, 486 U. S. 517, 524 (1988).
  It is true that we have spoken of a distinction between a
right not to be tried and a right not to be convicted in one
context: when defining the scope of the collateral order
doctrine. E.g., Flanagan, supra, at 265–267. That is, we
have allowed defendants in federal criminal cases to take
an immediate appeal from the denial of a pretrial motion
when the right at issue is properly understood to be a
right not to be tried. A prime example is a case in which a
defendant claims that a prosecution would violate the
Double Jeopardy Clause. See Abney v. United States, 431
U. S. 651, 662 (1977). Allowing an interlocutory appeal in
that situation protects against all the harms that flow
from the prolongation of a case that should never have
been brought. See id., at 661. But that rationale cannot
justify the Menna-Blackledge doctrine, because allowing a
defendant to appeal after a guilty plea does not cut short a
prosecution that should never have been brought. On the
contrary, it prolongs the litigation. So the distinction
drawn in our collateral order cases makes no sense in
distinguishing between the claims that should and the
claims that should not survive a guilty plea.
  Nor, in any event, would such a rule be consistent with
the decision in Blackledge, because we have held that an
unsuccessful vindictive prosecution claim may not be
appealed before trial. United States v. Hollywood Motor
Car Co., 458 U. S. 263, 264 (1982) ( per curiam). And none
of this would do any good for Class, for we have never
10                  CLASS v. UNITED STATES

                        ALITO, J., dissenting

permitted a defendant to appeal a pretrial order rejecting
a constitutional challenge to the statute the defendant
allegedly violated. In fact we have repudiated the very
suggestion. Id., at 270.
  The upshot is that the supposed “right not to be prose-
cuted” has no intelligible meaning in this context. And
Blackledge identified no basis for this new right in the text
of the Constitution or history or prior precedent. What is
more, it did all this without bothering to consider the
understanding of a guilty plea under the law of the State
where the Blackledge defendant was convicted or anything
that was said to him or that he said at the time of his plea.
                             B
   If the thinking behind Blackledge is hard to follow,
Menna may be worse. In that case, the Court held that a
defendant who pleaded guilty could challenge his convic-
tion on double jeopardy grounds. 423 U. S., at 62. The
case was decided by a three-page per curiam opinion, its
entire analysis confined to a single footnote. And the
footnote, rather than elucidating what was said in Black-
ledge, substituted a different rationale. Arguing that
Tollett and the other prior related cases did not preclude
appellate review of the double jeopardy claim, the Court
wrote:
       “[A] counseled plea of guilty is an admission of factual
       guilt so reliable that, where voluntary and intelligent,
       it quite validly removes the issue of factual guilt from
       the case. In most cases, factual guilt is a sufficient
       basis for the State’s imposition of punishment. A
       guilty plea, therefore, simply renders irrelevant those
       constitutional violations not logically inconsistent
       with the valid establishment of factual guilt.” Menna,
       423 U. S., at 62–63, n. 2.
     The wording of the final sentence is not easy to parse,
                  Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)           11

                      ALITO, J., dissenting

but I interpret the Court’s reasoning as follows: A defend-
ant who pleads guilty does no more than admit that he
committed the essential conduct charged in the indict-
ment; therefore a guilty plea allows the litigation on ap-
peal of any claim that is not inconsistent with the facts
that the defendant necessarily admitted. If that is the
correct meaning, the sentence would overrule many of the
cases that it purported to distinguish, including Tollett,
which involved an unconstitutional grand jury claim. It
would contradict much that the Court had previously said
about the effect of a guilty plea. See, e.g., Boykin, 395
U. S., at 242 (“A plea of guilty is more than a confession
which admits that the accused did various acts; it is itself
a conviction”). And it would permit a defendant who
pleads guilty to raise on appeal a whole host of claims,
including, for example, the denial of motions to suppress
evidence allegedly obtained in violation of the Fourth,
Fifth, or Sixth Amendments. See, e.g., Linkletter v. Walker,
381 U. S. 618, 638 (1965) (most Fourth Amendment claims
have “no bearing on guilt”). A holding of that scope is not
what one expects to see in a footnote in a per curiam opin-
ion, but if the Court meant less, its meaning is unclear.
                              C
  When the Court returned to Blackledge and Menna in
United States v. Broce, 488 U. S. 563 (1989), the Court
essentially repudiated the theories offered in those earlier
cases. (The Court terms this a “reaffirm[ation].” Ante, at
6.) Like Menna, Broce involved a defendant (actually two
defendants) who pleaded guilty but then sought to attack
their convictions on double jeopardy grounds. 488 U. S., at
565. This time, however, the Court held that their guilty
pleas prevented them from litigating their claims. Ibid.
  The Court began by specifically disavowing Menna’s
suggestion that a guilty plea admits only “ ‘factual guilt,’ ”
meaning “the acts described in the indictments.” Broce,
12                   CLASS v. UNITED STATES

                         ALITO, J., dissenting

488 U. S., at 568–569. Instead, the Court explained, an
unconditional guilty plea admits “all of the factual and
legal elements necessary to sustain a binding, final judg-
ment of guilt and a lawful sentence.” Id., at 569 (emphasis
added). “By entering a plea of guilty, the accused is not
simply stating that he did the discrete acts described in
the indictment; he is admitting guilt of a substantive
crime.” Id., at 570. Such “admissions,” Broce continued,
are “necessarily made upon entry of a voluntary plea of
guilty.” Id., at 573–574. And invoking Tollett, the Court
added that it makes no difference whether the defendant
“ ‘may not have correctly appraised the constitutional
significance of certain historical facts.’ ” 488 U. S., at 572
(quoting 411 U. S., at 267). Thus, the Court concluded, a
defendant’s decision to plead guilty necessarily extin-
guishes whatever “potential defense[s]” he might have
asserted in an effort to show that it would be unlawful to
hold him liable for his conduct. 488 U. S., at 573. So
much for Menna.
   As for Blackledge, by holding that the defendants’ dou-
ble jeopardy rights were extinguished by their pleas, Broce
necessarily rejected the idea that a right not to be tried
survives an unconditional guilty plea. See Abney, 431
U. S., at 662 (holding for collateral-order-doctrine purposes
that the Double Jeopardy Clause confers a right not to be
tried).
   While Broce thus rejected the reasoning in Blackledge
and Menna, the Court was content to distinguish those
cases on the ground that they involved defendants who
could succeed on appeal without going beyond “the exist-
ing record,” whereas the defendants in Broce would have
to present new evidence. Broce, supra, at 575.4
——————
  4 The majority asserts that, unlike the defendants in Broce, Class can

make out his constitutional arguments without needing to undertake
any factual development. Ante, at 6. It is difficult to see how that can

                              A

   This is where the Menna-Blackledge doctrine stood
when we heard this case. Now, instead of clarifying the
law, the Court sows new confusion by reiterating with
seeming approval a string of catchphrases. The Court
repeats the line that an argument survives if it “implicates
‘the very power of the State’ to prosecute the defendant,”
ante, at 4 (quoting Blackledge, 417 U. S., at 30), but this
shibboleth is no more intelligible now than it was when
first incanted in Blackledge. The Court also parrots the
rule set out in the Menna footnote—that the only argu-
ments waived by a guilty plea are those that contradict
the facts alleged in the charging document, see ante, at 5–
6, even though that rule is inconsistent with Tollett, the
Brady trilogy, and Broce—and even though this reading
——————
be true. Class’s Second Amendment argument is that banning firearms
in the Maryland Avenue parking lot of the Capitol Building goes too
far, at least as applied to him specifically. As his court-appointed
amicus presented it to the Court of Appeals, this argument depends on
Class’s own personal characteristics, including his record of mental
health and law abidingness, as well as characteristics specific to the
Maryland Avenue parking lot, including, inter alia, its distance from
the Capitol Building, the extent to which it is unsecured, the extent to
which it is publicly accessible, what business typically occurs there,
who regularly congregates there, and the nature of security screening
visitors must pass through upon entering. See Opening Brief of Court-
Appointed Amicus Curiae in Support of Appellant in No. 15–3015
(CADC), pp. 34–35, 41–45. Similarly, Class’s due process argument
requires an assessment of how difficult it would be for an average
person to determine that the Maryland Avenue lot is part of the Capitol
Grounds, which turns on the extent to which the lot is publicly acces-
sible, how heavily trafficked it is and by what types of vehicles, whether
there are signs indicating it is part of the Capitol Grounds or that guns
are prohibited and where such signs are located, and whether there are
security gates or checkpoints nearby. See id., at 51, 53. These argu-
ments require facts. I understand the majority opinion to preclude
Class from gathering any of them that are not already in the District
Court record.
14                CLASS v. UNITED STATES

                     ALITO, J., dissenting

would permit a defendant who pleads guilty to raise an
uncertain assortment of claims never before thought to
survive a guilty plea.
   For example, would this rule permit a defendant to
argue that his prosecution is barred by a statute of limita-
tions or by the Speedy Trial Act? Presumably the answer
is yes. By admitting commission of the acts alleged in an
indictment or complaint, a defendant would not concede
that the charge was timely. What about the argument
that a defendant’s alleged conduct does not violate the
statute of conviction? Here again, the rule barring only
those claims inconsistent with the facts alleged in the
indictment or complaint would appear to permit the issue
to be raised on appeal, but the Court says that a defendant
who pleads guilty “has admitted the charges against him.”
Ante, at 7. What does this mean, exactly? The majority is
coy, but “admit[ing] the charges against him” would ap-
pear to mean admitting that his conduct satisfies each
element of the statute he is charged with violating. It
must mean that because we have held that if a defendant
does not understand that he is admitting his conduct
satisfies each element of the crime, his guilty plea is in-
voluntary and unintelligent and therefore invalid. Hen-
derson v. Morgan, 426 U. S. 637, 644–645 (1976). So if a
defendant who pleads guilty “admit[s] the charges against
him,” and if he does not claim that his plea was involun-
tary or unintelligent, his plea must be taken as an admis-
sion that he did everything the statute forbids.
   But if that is so, then what about the rule suggested by
the old Massachusetts opinion the Court touts? There,
Justice Ames wrote that a guilty plea does not waive the
right to argue that “ ‘the facts alleged and admitted do not
constitute a crime against the laws of the Common-
wealth.’ ” Ante, at 5 (quoting Commonwealth v. Hinds, 101
Mass. 209, 210 (1869)). Does the Court agree with Justice
Ames, or not?
                  Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)           15

                      ALITO, J., dissenting

   Approaching the question from the opposite direction,
the Court says that a guilty plea precludes a defendant
from litigating “the constitutionality of case-related gov-
ernment conduct that takes place before the plea is en-
tered.” Ante, at 8. This category is most mysterious. I
thought Class was arguing that the Government violated
the Constitution at the moment when it initiated his
prosecution. That sounds like he is trying to attack “the
constitutionality of case-related government conduct that
[took] place before the plea [was] entered.” Yet the Court
holds that he may proceed. Why?
   Finally, the majority instructs that “a valid guilty plea
relinquishes any claim that would contradict the ‘admis-
sions necessarily made upon entry of a voluntary plea of
guilty.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Broce, 488 U. S., at 573–574). I
agree with that statement of the rule, but what the Court
fails to acknowledge is that the scope of this rule depends
on the law of the particular jurisdiction in question. If a
defendant in federal court is told that under Rule 11 an
unconditional guilty plea waives all nonjurisdictional
claims (or as Broce put it, admits “all of the factual and
legal elements necessary to sustain a binding, final judg-
ment of guilt and a lawful sentence,” id., at 569), then that
is the scope of the admissions implicit in the plea.
                             B
   Perhaps sensing the incoherence of its effort, the majority
seeks refuge in history, asserting that today’s holding
“flows directly from this Court’s prior decisions.” Ante, at
3. But this history cannot prop up the Court’s decision.
Start with Haynes v. United States, 390 U. S. 85, 87, n. 2
(1968), in which the Court reached the merits of a defend-
ant’s constitutional challenge to his conviction despite the
fact that he had pleaded guilty. Ante, at 3–4. A moment’s
glance reveals that this decision is irrelevant for present
purposes (which presumably explains why it was not even
16                CLASS v. UNITED STATES

                      ALITO, J., dissenting

cited in Blackledge, Menna, Tollett, the Brady trilogy, or
Broce).
   In Haynes, the Government did not argue that the
defendant’s guilty plea barred him from pressing his
constitutional challenge on appeal. In fact, the Govern-
ment conceded that he would be entitled to relief if his
argument had merit. 390 U. S., at 100–101. No one has
suggested that a defendant’s guilty plea strips an appel-
late court of jurisdiction to entertain a constitutional
challenge to his conviction, so of course a reviewing court
need not dismiss an appeal sua sponte if the Government
does not assert the plea as a bar. But that tells us nothing
about what ought to happen when, as in this case, the
Government does argue that the defendant relinquished
his right to litigate his constitutional argument when he
opted to plead guilty.
   One must squint even harder to figure out why the
majority has dusted off Commonwealth v. Hinds, an 1869
decision of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts.
Ante, at 5. Hinds involved a state-law motion (“arrest of
judgment”) to set aside a conviction for a state-law crime
(common law forgery), in a state-court proceeding after the
defendant pleaded guilty. 101 Mass., at 210. One might
already be wondering what relevance the effect of a guilty
plea in state court, under state law, could have with re-
spect to the effect of a guilty plea in federal court, under
federal law. But in any event, what Hinds says about
guilty pleas is not helpful to Class at all. In Massachu-
setts at that time, motions to arrest a judgment could be
maintained only on the ground that the court that ren-
dered the judgment lacked jurisdiction. Mass. Gen. Stat.
§79 (1860); Commonwealth v. Eagan, 103 Mass. 71, 72
(1860); 3 F. Wharton, Criminal Law §3202, p. 177 (7th
rev. ed. 1874). And Massachusetts, like all the other
States, can define the jurisdiction of its courts as it pleases
(except insofar as federal law validly prevents).

                      ALITO, J., dissenting

   Thus, to the extent Hinds “reflect[s] an understanding
of the nature of guilty pleas,” ante, at 5, it reflects nothing
more than the idea that a defendant can assert jurisdic-
tional defects even after pleading guilty. That rule is
utterly unremarkable and of no help to Class. Today—as
well as at the time of the founding—federal courts have
jurisdiction over cases charging federal crimes. See 18
U. S. C. §3231; §9, 1 Stat. 76–77. And as early as 1830,
the Court rejected the suggestion that a federal court is
deprived of jurisdiction if “the indictment charges an
offence not punishable criminally according to the law of
the land.” Ex parte Watkins, 3 Pet. 193, 203. We have
repeatedly reaffirmed that proposition. See, e.g., Lamar v.
United States, 240 U. S. 60, 64 (1916) (court not deprived
of jurisdiction even if “the indictment does not charge a
crime against the United States”); United States v. Wil-
liams, 341 U. S. 58, 68–69 (1951) (same, even if “the stat-
ute is wholly unconstitutional, or . . . the facts stated in
the indictment do not constitute a crime”); Cotton, 535
U. S., at 630–631. And although a handful of our “post–
1867 cases” suggested that a criminal court lacked juris-
diction if “the statute under which [the defendant] had
been convicted was unconstitutional,” those suggestions
“reflected a ‘softening’ of the concept of jurisdiction” rather
than that concept’s originally understood—and modern—
meaning. Danforth v. Minnesota, 552 U. S. 264, 272, n. 6
(2008).
                        *     *    *
   In sum, the governing law in the present case is Rule 11
of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Under that
Rule, an unconditional guilty plea waives all nonjurisdic-
tional claims with the possible exception of the “Menna-
Blackledge doctrine” created years ago by this Court. That
doctrine is vacuous, has no sound foundation, and produces
nothing but confusion. At a minimum, I would limit the
18                CLASS v. UNITED STATES

                      ALITO, J., dissenting

doctrine to the particular types of claims involved in those
cases. I certainly would not expand its reach.
   I fear that today’s decision will bedevil the lower courts.
I respectfully dissent.

          DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. v. SOMERS

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT

No. 16–1276. Argued November 28, 2017—Decided February 21, 2018
Endeavoring to root out corporate fraud, Congress passed the Sar-
 banes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley) and the 2010 Dodd-Frank
 Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank).
 Both Acts shield whistleblowers from retaliation, but they differ in
 important respects. Sarbanes-Oxley applies to all “employees” who
 report misconduct to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC
 or Commission), any other federal agency, Congress, or an internal
 supervisor. </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">18</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §1514A(a)(1). Dodd-Frank defines a “whistle-
 blower” as “any individual who provides . . . information relating to a
 violation of the securities laws to the Commission, in a manner estab-
 lished, by rule or regulation, by the Commission.” </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">15</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §78u–
 6(a)(6). A whistleblower so defined is eligible for an award if original
 information provided to the SEC leads to a successful enforcement
 action. §78u–6(b)–(g). And he or she is protected from retaliation in
 three situations, see §78u–6(h)(1)(A)(i)–(iii), including for “making
 disclosures that are required or protected under” Sarbanes-Oxley or
 other specified laws, §78u–6(h)(1)(A)(iii). Sarbanes-Oxley’s anti-
 retaliation provision contains an administrative-exhaustion require-
 ment and a 180-day administrative complaint-filing deadline, see </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">18</span>
 <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §1514A(b)(1)(A), (2)(D), whereas Dodd-Frank permits a whis-
 tleblower to sue an employer directly in federal district court, with a
 default six-year limitation period, see §78u–6(h)(1)(B)(i), (iii)(I)(aa).
    The SEC’s regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank provision
 contain two discrete whistleblower definitions. For purposes of the
 award program, Rule 21F–2 requires a whistleblower to “provide the
 Commission with information” relating to possible securities-law vio-
 lations. 17 CFR §240.21F–2(a)(1). For purposes of the anti-
 retaliation protections, however, the Rule does not require SEC re-

    porting. See §240.21F–2(b)(1)(i)–(ii).
      Respondent Paul Somers alleges that petitioner Digital Realty
    Trust, Inc. (Digital Realty) terminated his employment shortly after
    he reported to senior management suspected securities-law violations
    by the company. Somers filed suit, alleging, inter alia, a claim of
    whistleblower retaliation under Dodd-Frank. Digital Realty moved
    to dismiss that claim on the ground that Somers was not a whistle-
    blower under §78u–6(h) because he did not alert the SEC prior to his
    termination. The District Court denied the motion, and the Ninth
    Circuit affirmed. The Court of Appeals concluded that §78u–6(h)
    does not necessitate recourse to the SEC prior to gaining “whistle-
    blower” status, and it accorded deference to the SEC’s regulation un-
    der Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,
    </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""111221""><a href=""/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/""><span class=""volume"">467</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">837</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">.
Held: Dodd-Frank’s anti-retaliation provision does not extend to an
 individual, like Somers, who has not reported a violation of the secu-
 rities laws to the SEC. Pp. 9–19.
    (a) A statute’s explicit definition must be followed, even if it varies
 from a term’s ordinary meaning. Burgess v. United States, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""145816""><a href=""/opinion/145816/burgess-v-united-states/""><span class=""volume"">553</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span>
 <span class=""page"">124</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 130. Section 78u–6(a) instructs that the statute’s definition of
 “whistleblower” “shall apply” “[i]n this section,” that is, throughout
 §78u–6. The Court must therefore interpret the term “whistleblower”
 in §78u–6(h), the anti-retaliation provision, in accordance with that
 definition.
    The whistleblower definition operates in conjunction with the three
 clauses of §78u–6(h)(1)(A) to spell out the provision’s scope. The def-
 inition first describes who is eligible for protection—namely, a “whis-
 tleblower” who provides pertinent information “to the Commission.”
 §78u–6(a)(6). The three clauses then describe what conduct, when
 engaged in by a “whistleblower,” is shielded from employment dis-
 crimination. An individual who meets both measures may invoke
 Dodd-Frank’s protections. But an individual who falls outside the
 protected category of “whistleblowers” is ineligible to seek redress
 under the statute, regardless of the conduct in which that individual
 engages. This reading is reinforced by another whistleblower-
 protection provision in Dodd-Frank, see </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">12</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §5567(b), which
 imposes no requirement that information be conveyed to a govern-
 ment agency. Pp. 9–11.
    (b) The Court’s understanding is corroborated by Dodd-Frank’s
 purpose and design. The core objective of Dodd-Frank’s whistleblow-
 er program is to aid the Commission’s enforcement efforts by “moti-
 vat[ing] people who know of securities law violations to tell the SEC.”
 S. Rep. No. 111–176, p. 38 (emphasis added). To that end, Congress
 provided monetary awards to whistleblowers who furnish actionable
                    Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)                      3

                               Syllabus

information to the Commission. Congress also complemented the fi-
nancial incentives for SEC reporting by heightening protection
against retaliation. Pp. 11–12.
   (c) Somers and the Solicitor General contend that Dodd-Frank’s
“whistleblower” definition applies only to the statute’s award pro-
gram and not, as the definition plainly states, to its anti-retaliation
provision. Their concerns do not support a departure from the statu-
tory text. Pp. 12–18.
      (1) They claim that the Court’s reading would vitiate the protec-
tions of clause (iii) for whistleblowers who make disclosures to per-
sons and entities other than the SEC. See §78u–6(h)(1)(A)(iii). But
the plain-text reading of the statute leaves the third clause with sub-
stantial meaning by protecting a whistleblower who reports miscon-
duct both to the SEC and to another entity, but suffers retaliation be-
cause of the latter, non-SEC, disclosure. Pp. 13–15.
      (2) Nor would the Court’s reading jettison protections for audi-
tors, attorneys, and other employees who are required to report in-
formation within the company before making external disclosures.
Such employees would be shielded as soon as they also provide rele-
vant information to the Commission. And Congress may well have
considered adequate the safeguards already afforded to such employ-
ees by Sarbanes-Oxley. Pp. 15–16.
      (3) Applying the “whistleblower” definition as written, Somers
and the Solicitor General further protest, will allow “identical mis-
conduct” to “go punished or not based on the happenstance of a sepa-
rate report” to the SEC. Brief for Respondent 37–38. But it is under-
standable that the statute’s retaliation protections, like its financial
rewards, would be reserved for employees who have done what Dodd-
Frank seeks to achieve by reporting information about unlawful ac-
tivity to the SEC. P. 16.
      (4) The Solicitor General observes that the statute contains no
apparent requirement of a “temporal or topical connection between
the violation reported to the Commission and the internal disclosure
for which the employee suffers retaliation.” Brief for United States
as Amicus Curiae 25. The Court need not dwell on related hypotheti-
cals, which veer far from the case at hand. Pp. 16–18.
      (5) Finally, the interpretation adopted here would not undermine
clause (ii) of §78u–6(h)(1)(A), which prohibits retaliation against a
whistleblower for “initiating, testifying in, or assisting in any investi-
gation or . . . action of the Commission based upon” information con-
veyed to the SEC by a whistleblower in accordance with the statute.
The statute delegates authority to the Commission to establish the
“manner” in which a whistleblower may provide information to the
SEC. §78u–6(a)(6). Nothing prevents the Commission from enumer-
4              DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. v. SOMERS

                                  Syllabus

    ating additional means of SEC reporting, including through testimo-
    ny protected by clause (ii). P. 18.
      (d) Because “Congress has directly spoken to the precise question
    at issue,” Chevron, 467 U. S., at 842, deference is not accorded to the
    contrary view advanced by the SEC in Rule 21F–2. Pp. 18–19.

 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

                              [February 21, 2018]


   JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.
   Endeavoring to root out corporate fraud, Congress
passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 116 Stat. 745
(Sarbanes-Oxley), and the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act, 124 Stat. 1376
(Dodd-Frank).      Both Acts shield whistleblowers from
retaliation, but they differ in important respects. Most
notably, Sarbanes-Oxley applies to all “employees” who
report misconduct to the Securities and Exchange Com-
mission (SEC or Commission), any other federal agency,
Congress, or an internal supervisor.             </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">18</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">.
§1514A(a)(1). Dodd-Frank delineates a more circum-
scribed class; it defines “whistleblower” to mean a person
who provides “information relating to a violation of the
securities laws to the Commission.” </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">15</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §78u–
6(a)(6). A whistleblower so defined is eligible for an award
if original information he or she provides to the SEC leads
to a successful enforcement action. §78u–6(b)–(g). And,
most relevant here, a whistleblower is protected from
retaliation for, inter alia, “making disclosures that are
required or protected under” Sarbanes-Oxley, the Securi-

proscription at </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">18</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §1513(e), or any other

§78u–6(h)(1)(A)(iii).
   The question presented: Does the anti-retaliation provi-
sion of Dodd-Frank extend to an individual who has not
reported a violation of the securities laws to the SEC and
therefore falls outside the Act’s definition of “whistleblow-
er”? Pet. for Cert. (I). We answer that question “No”: To
sue under Dodd-Frank’s anti-retaliation provision, a per-
son must first “provid[e] . . . information relating to a
violation of the securities laws to the Commission.”
§78u–6(a)(6).

  “To safeguard investors in public companies and restore
trust in the financial markets following the collapse of
Enron Corporation,” Congress enacted Sarbanes-Oxley in
2002. Lawson v. FMR LLC, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">571</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">429</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, ___ (2014) (slip

new protections for employees at risk of retaliation for
reporting corporate misconduct. See </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">18</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §1514A.
Section 1514A prohibits certain companies from discharg-
ing or otherwise “discriminat[ing] against an employee in
the terms and conditions of employment because” the
employee “provid[es] information . . . or otherwise assist[s]
in an investigation regarding any conduct which the em-
ployee reasonably believes constitutes a violation” of cer-
tain criminal fraud statutes, any SEC rule or regulation,
or “any provision of Federal law relating to fraud against
shareholders.” §1514A(a)(1). An employee qualifies for
protection when he or she provides information or assis-
tance either to a federal regulatory or law enforcement
agency, Congress, or any “person with supervisory author-
                      Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)                      3

ity over the employee.” §1514A(a)(1)(A)–(C).1
   To recover under §1514A, an aggrieved employee must
exhaust administrative remedies by “filing a complaint
with the Secretary of Labor.” §1514A(b)(1)(A); see Law-
son, 571 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 5–6). Congress
prescribed a 180-day limitation period for filing such a
complaint. §1514A(b)(2)(D). If the agency “does not issue
a final decision within 180 days of the filing of [a] com-
plaint, and the [agency’s] delay is not due to bad faith on
the claimant’s part, the claimant may proceed to federal
district court for de novo review.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6)
(citing §1514A(b)). An employee who prevails in a pro-
ceeding under §1514A is “entitled to all relief necessary to
make the employee whole,” including reinstatement,
backpay with interest, and any “special damages sus-
tained as a result of the discrimination,” among such
damages, litigation costs. §1514A(c).

   At issue in this case is the Dodd-Frank anti-retaliation
provision enacted in 2010, eight years after the enactment
of Sarbanes-Oxley. Passed in the wake of the 2008 finan-
cial crisis, Dodd-Frank aimed to “promote the financial
stability of the United States by improving accountability
and transparency in the financial system.” 124 Stat. 1376.
   Dodd-Frank responded to numerous perceived short-
comings in financial regulation. Among them was the
SEC’s need for additional “power, assistance and money at
its disposal” to regulate securities markets. S. Rep. No.
111–176, pp. 36, 37 (2010). To assist the Commission “in

                      Opinion of the Court

identifying securities law violations,” the Act established
“a new, robust whistleblower program designed to moti-
vate people who know of securities law violations to tell
the SEC.” Id., at 38. And recognizing that “whistleblow-
ers often face the difficult choice between telling the truth
and . . . committing ‘career suicide,’ ” Congress sought to
protect whistleblowers from employment discrimination.
Id., at 111, 112.
   Dodd-Frank implemented these goals by adding a new
provision to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934: </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">15</span>
<span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §78u–6. Section 78u–6 begins by defining a
“whistleblower” as “any individual who provides . . . in-
formation relating to a violation of the securities laws to
the Commission, in a manner established, by rule or regu-
lation, by the Commission.”          §78u–6(a)(6) (emphasis
added). That definition, the statute directs, “shall apply”
“[i]n this section”—i.e., throughout §78u–6. §78u–6(a).
   Section 78u–6 affords covered whistleblowers both
incentives and protection. First, the section creates an
award program for “whistleblowers who voluntarily
provid[e] original information to the Commission that
le[ads] to the successful enforcement of [a] covered judicial
or administrative action.” §78u–6(b)(1). A qualifying
whistleblower is entitled to a cash award of 10 to 30 per-
cent of the monetary sanctions collected in the enforce-
ment action. See §78u–6(b)(1)(A)–(B).
   Second, §78u–6(h) prohibits an employer from discharg-
ing, harassing, or otherwise discriminating against a
“whistleblower” “because of any lawful act done by the
whistleblower” in three situations: first, “in providing
information to the Commission in accordance with [§78u–
6],” §78u–6(h)(1)(A)(i); second, “in initiating, testifying in,
or assisting in any investigation or . . . action of the Com-
mission based upon” information provided to the SEC in
accordance with §78u–6, §78u–6(h)(1)(A)(ii); and third, “in
making disclosures that are required or protected under”

1934, the criminal anti-retaliation prohibition at </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">18</span>
<span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §1513(e),2 or “any other law, rule, or regulation
subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission,” §78u–
6(h)(1)(A)(iii). Clause (iii), by cross-referencing Sarbanes-
Oxley and other laws, protects disclosures made to a
variety of individuals and entities in addition to the SEC.
For example, the clause shields an employee’s reports of
wrongdoing to an internal supervisor if the reports are
independently safeguarded from retaliation under Sarbanes-
Oxley. See supra, at 2–3.3
  The recovery procedures under the anti-retaliation
provisions of Dodd-Frank and Sarbanes-Oxley differ in
critical respects. First, unlike Sarbanes-Oxley, which
contains an administrative-exhaustion requirement and a
180-day administrative complaint-filing deadline, see </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">18</span>
<span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §1514A(b)(1)(A), (2)(D), Dodd-Frank permits a
whistleblower to sue a current or former employer directly
——————
  2 Section   1513(e) provides: “Whoever knowingly, with the intent to
retaliate, takes any action harmful to any person, including interfer-
ence with the lawful employment or livelihood of any person, for provid-
ing to a law enforcement officer any truthful information relating to the
commission or possible commission of any Federal offense, shall be
fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.”
   3 Section 78u–6(h)(1)(A) reads in full:

   “No employer may discharge, demote, suspend, threaten, harass,
directly or indirectly, or in any other manner discriminate against, a
whistleblower in the terms and conditions of employment because of
any lawful act done by the whistleblower—
   “(i) in providing information to the Commission in accordance with
this section;
   “(ii) in initiating, testifying in, or assisting in any investigation or
judicial or administrative action of the Commission based upon or
related to such information; or
   “(iii) in making disclosures that are required or protected under the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (</pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">15</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §7201 et seq.), this chapter,
including section 78j–l(m) of this title, section 1513(e) of title 18, and
any other law, rule, or regulation subject to the jurisdiction of the
Commission.”

in federal district court, with a default limitation period of
six years, see §78u–6(h)(1)(B)(i), (iii)(I)(aa). Second, Dodd-
Frank instructs a court to award to a prevailing plaintiff
double backpay with interest, see §78u–6(h)(1)(C)(ii),
while Sarbanes-Oxley limits recovery to actual backpay
with interest, see </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">18</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §1514A(c)(2)(B). Like Sarbanes-
Oxley, however, Dodd-Frank authorizes reinstatement
and compensation for litigation costs, expert witness fees,
and reasonable attorneys’ fees.               Compare §78u–
6(h)(1)(C)(i), (iii), with </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">18</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §1514A(c)(2)(A), (C).4

   Congress authorized the SEC “to issue such rules and
regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to imple-
ment the provisions of [§78u–6] consistent with the pur-
poses of this section.” §78u–6(j). Pursuant to this author-
ity, the SEC published a notice of proposed rulemaking to
“Implemen[t] the Whistleblower Provisions” of Dodd-
Frank. 75 Fed. Reg. 70488 (2010). Proposed Rule 21F–
2(a) defined a “whistleblower,” for purposes of both the
award and anti-retaliation provisions of §78u–6, as one or
more individuals who “provide the Commission with in-
formation relating to a potential violation of the securities
laws.” Id., at 70519 (proposed 17 CFR §240.21F–2(a)).
The proposed rule, the agency noted, “tracks the statutory
definition of a ‘whistleblower’ ” by requiring information
reporting to the SEC itself. 75 Fed. Reg. 70489.
   In promulgating the final Rule, however, the agency
changed course. Rule 21F–2, in finished form, contains
two discrete “whistleblower” definitions. See 17 CFR
§240.21F–2(a)–(b) (2017). For purposes of the award

. . . you provide the Commission with information . . .
relat[ing] to a possible violation of the Federal securities
laws.” §240.21F–2(a)(1) (emphasis added). The infor-
mation must be provided to the SEC through its website
or by mailing or faxing a specified form to the SEC Office
of the Whistleblower. See ibid.; §240.21F–9(a)(1)–(2).
    “For purposes of the anti-retaliation protections,” how-
ever, the Rule states that “[y]ou are a whistleblower if . . .
[y]ou possess a reasonable belief that the information you
are providing relates to a possible securities law violation”
and “[y]ou provide that information in a manner described
in” clauses (i) through (iii) of §78u–6(h)(1)(A). 17 CFR
§240.21F–2(b)(1)(i)–(ii). “The anti-retaliation protections
apply,” the Rule emphasizes, “whether or not you satisfy
the requirements, procedures and conditions to qualify for
an award.” §240.21F–2(b)(1)(iii). An individual may
therefore gain anti-retaliation protection as a “whistle-
blower” under Rule 21F–2 without providing information
to the SEC, so long as he or she provides information in a
manner shielded by one of the anti-retaliation provision’s
three clauses. For example, a report to a company super-
visor would qualify if the report garners protection under
the Sarbanes-Oxley anti-retaliation provision.5

  Petitioner Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (Digital Realty) is a

Realty employed respondent Paul Somers as a Vice Presi-

nated him shortly after he reported to senior management
suspected securities-law violations by the company. See

  5 In 2015, the SEC issued an interpretive rule reiterating that anti-

retaliation protection is not contingent on a whistleblower’s provision of
information to the Commission. See 80 Fed. Reg. 47829 (2015).

§1514A(b)(2)(D).
   Somers brought suit in the United States District Court
for the Northern District of California alleging, inter alia,
a claim of whistleblower retaliation under Dodd-Frank.
Digital Realty moved to dismiss that claim, arguing that
“Somers does not qualify as a ‘whistleblower’ under [§78u–
6(h)] because he did not report any alleged law violations
to the SEC.” </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">119</span> <span class=""reporter"">F. Supp.</span> <span class=""page"">3d</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, at 1094. The District Court
denied the motion. Rule 21F–2, the court observed, does
not necessitate recourse to the SEC prior to gaining “whis-
tleblower” status under Dodd-Frank. See id., at 1095–
1096. Finding the statutory scheme ambiguous, the court
accorded deference to the SEC’s Rule under Chevron
U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,
</pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""111221""><a href=""/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/""><span class=""volume"">467</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">837</span></a></span><pre class=""inline""> (1984).

(2017). The majority acknowledged that Dodd-Frank’s
definitional provision describes a “whistleblower” as an
individual who provides information to the SEC itself. Id.,
at 1049.      But applying that definition to the anti-
retaliation provision, the majority reasoned, would narrow
the third clause of §78u–6(h)(1)(A) “to the point of absurd-
ity”: The statute would protect employees only if they
“reported possible securities violations both internally and
to the SEC.” Ibid. Such dual reporting, the majority
believed, was unlikely to occur. Ibid. Therefore, the
majority concluded, the statute should be read to protect
employees who make disclosures privileged by clause (iii)
of §78u–6(h)(1)(A), whether or not those employees also
provide information to the SEC. Id., at 1050. In any

event, the majority held, the SEC’s resolution of any stat-
utory ambiguity warranted deference. Ibid. Judge Owens
dissented. In his view, the statutory definition of whistle-
blower was clear, left no room for interpretation, and
plainly governed. Id., at 1051.
   Two other Courts of Appeals have weighed in on the
question before us. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth
Circuit has held that employees must provide information
to the SEC to avail themselves of Dodd-Frank’s anti-
retaliation safeguard. See Asadi v. G. E. Energy (USA),
L. L. C., </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">720</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.3d</span> <span class=""page"">620</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 630 (2013). A divided panel of the
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reached the oppo-
site conclusion, over a dissent by Judge Jacobs. See Ber-

                             II
   “When a statute includes an explicit definition, we must
follow that definition,” even if it varies from a term’s
ordinary meaning. Burgess v. United States, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""145816""><a href=""/opinion/145816/burgess-v-united-states/""><span class=""volume"">553</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span>
<span class=""page"">124</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 130 (2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). This
principle resolves the question before us.
                               A
   Our charge in this review proceeding is to determine the
meaning of “whistleblower” in §78u–6(h), Dodd-Frank’s
anti-retaliation provision. The definition section of the
statute supplies an unequivocal answer: A “whistleblower”
is “any individual who provides . . . information relating to
a violation of the securities laws to the Commission.”
§78u–6(a)(6) (emphasis added). Leaving no doubt as to
the definition’s reach, the statute instructs that the “defi-
nitio[n] shall apply” “[i]n this section,” that is, throughout
§78u–6. §78u–6(a)(6).
   The whistleblower definition operates in conjunction
10         DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. v. SOMERS

                      Opinion of the Court

with the three clauses of §78u–6(h)(1)(A) to spell out the
provision’s scope. The definition first describes who is
eligible for protection—namely, a whistleblower who
provides pertinent information “to the Commission.”
§78u–6(a)(6). The three clauses of §78u–6(h)(1)(A) then
describe what conduct, when engaged in by a whistle-
blower, is shielded from employment discrimination. See
§78u–6(h)(1)(A)(i)–(iii). An individual who meets both
measures may invoke Dodd-Frank’s protections. But an
individual who falls outside the protected category of
“whistleblowers” is ineligible to seek redress under the
statute, regardless of the conduct in which that individual
engages.
   Reinforcing our reading, another whistleblower-
protection provision in Dodd-Frank imposes no require-
ment that information be conveyed to a government agency.
Title 10 of the statute, which created the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), prohibits discrimina-
tion against a “covered employee” who, among other
things, “provide[s] . . . information to [his or her] employer,
the Bureau, or any other State, local, or Federal, govern-
ment authority or law enforcement agency relating to” a
violation of a law subject to the CFPB’s jurisdiction. </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">12</span>
<span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §5567(a)(1). To qualify as a “covered employee,”
an individual need not provide information to the CFPB,
or any other entity. See §5567(b) (“covered employee”
means “any individual performing tasks related to the
offering or provision of a consumer financial product or
service”).
   “[W]hen Congress includes particular language in one
section of a statute but omits it in another[,] . . . this Court
presumes that Congress intended a difference in mean-
ing.” Loughrin v. United States, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">573</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">___, ___ (2014)
(slip op., at 6) (internal quotation marks and alteration
omitted). Congress placed a government-reporting re-
quirement in §78u–6(h), but not elsewhere in the same

                     Opinion of the Court

statute. Courts are not at liberty to dispense with the
condition—tell the SEC—Congress imposed.
                              B
  Dodd-Frank’s purpose and design corroborate our com-
prehension of §78u–6(h)’s reporting requirement. The
“core objective” of Dodd-Frank’s robust whistleblower
program, as Somers acknowledges, Tr. of Oral Arg. 45, is
“to motivate people who know of securities law violations
to tell the SEC,” S. Rep. No. 111–176, at 38 (emphasis
added). By enlisting whistleblowers to “assist the Gov-
ernment [in] identify[ing] and prosecut[ing] persons who
have violated securities laws,” Congress undertook to
improve SEC enforcement and facilitate the Commission’s
“recover[y] [of] money for victims of financial fraud.” Id.,
at 110. To that end, §78u–6 provides substantial mone-
tary rewards to whistleblowers who furnish actionable
information to the SEC. See §78u–6(b).
  Financial inducements alone, Congress recognized, may
be insufficient to encourage certain employees, fearful of
employer retaliation, to come forward with evidence of
wrongdoing. Congress therefore complemented the Dodd-
Frank monetary incentives for SEC reporting by heighten-
ing protection against retaliation. While Sarbanes-Oxley
contains an administrative-exhaustion requirement, a
180-day administrative complaint-filing deadline, and a
remedial scheme limited to actual damages, Dodd-Frank
provides for immediate access to federal court, a generous
statute of limitations (at least six years), and the oppor-
tunity to recover double backpay. See supra, at 5–6.
Dodd-Frank’s award program and anti-retaliation provi-
sion thus work synchronously to motivate individuals with
knowledge of illegal activity to “tell the SEC.” S. Rep. No.
111–176, at 38.
  When enacting Sarbanes-Oxley’s whistleblower regime,
in comparison, Congress had a more far-reaching objec-
12        DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. v. SOMERS

                     Opinion of the Court

tive: It sought to disturb the “corporate code of silence”
that “discourage[d] employees from reporting fraudulent
behavior not only to the proper authorities, such as the
FBI and the SEC, but even internally.” Lawson, 571 U. S.,
at ___ (slip op., at 4) (internal quotation marks omitted).
Accordingly, the Sarbanes-Oxley anti-retaliation provision
covers employees who report fraud not only to the SEC,
but also to any other federal agency, Congress, or an
internal supervisor. See </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">18</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §1514A(a)(1).
                               C
   In sum, Dodd-Frank’s text and purpose leave no doubt
that the term “whistleblower” in §78u–6(h) carries the
meaning set forth in the section’s definitional provision.
The disposition of this case is therefore evident: Somers
did not provide information “to the Commission” before his
termination, §78u–6(a)(6), so he did not qualify as a “whis-
tleblower” at the time of the alleged retaliation. He is
therefore ineligible to seek relief under §78u–6(h).
                              III
  Somers and the Solicitor General tender a different view
of Dodd-Frank’s compass. The whistleblower definition,
as they see it, applies only to the statute’s award program,
not to its anti-retaliation provision, and thus not, as the
definition plainly states, throughout “this section,” §78u–
6(a). See Brief for Respondent 30; Brief for United States
as Amicus Curiae 10–11. For purposes of the anti-
retaliation provision alone, they urge us to construe the
term “whistleblower” in its “ordinary sense,” i.e., without
any SEC-reporting requirement. Brief for Respondent 18.
  Doing so, Somers and the Solicitor General contend,
would align with our precedent, specifically Lawson v.
Suwannee Fruit & S. S. Co., </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""104631""><a href=""/opinion/104631/lawson-v-suwannee-fruit-ss-co/""><span class=""volume"">336</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">198</span></a></span><pre class=""inline""> (1949), and

In those decisions, we declined to apply a statutory defini-

tion that ostensibly governed where doing so would have
been “incompatible with . . . Congress’ regulatory scheme,”
id., at ___ (slip op., at 18) (internal quotation marks omit-
ted), or would have “destroy[ed] one of the [statute’s]
major purposes,” Suwannee Fruit, 336 U. S., at 201.
   This case is of a piece, Somers and the Solicitor General
maintain. Applying the statutory definition here, they
variously charge, would “create obvious incongruities,”
Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 19 (internal
quotation marks omitted), “produce anomalous results,”
id., at 22, “vitiate much of the [statute’s] protection,” id.,
at 20 (internal quotation marks omitted), and, as the
Court of Appeals put it, narrow clause (iii) of §78u–
6(h)(1)(A) “to the point of absurdity,” Brief for Respondent
35 (quoting </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">850</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.</span> <span class=""page"">3d</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, at 1049). We next address these
concerns and explain why they do not lead us to depart
from the statutory text.
                               A
   It would gut “much of the protection afforded by” the
third clause of §78u–6(h)(1)(a), Somers and the Solicitor
General urge most strenuously, to apply the whistleblower
definition to the anti-retaliation provision. Brief for United
States as Amicus Curiae 20 (internal quotation marks
omitted); Brief for Respondent 28–29. As earlier noted,
see supra, at 4–5, clause (iii) prohibits retaliation against
a “whistleblower” for “making disclosures” to various
persons and entities, including but not limited to the SEC,
to the extent those disclosures are “required or protected
under” various laws other than Dodd-Frank.              §78u–
6(h)(1)(A)(iii). Applying the statutory definition of whis-
tleblower, however, would limit clause (iii)’s protection to
“only those individuals who report to the Commission.”
Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 22.
   The plain-text reading of the statute undoubtedly
shields fewer individuals from retaliation than the alter-
14          DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. v. SOMERS

                        Opinion of the Court

native proffered by Somers and the Solicitor General. But
we do not agree that this consequence “vitiate[s]” clause
(iii)’s protection, id., at 20 (internal quotation marks omit-
ted), or ranks as “absur[d],” Brief for Respondent 35 (in-
ternal quotation marks omitted).6 In fact, our reading
leaves the third clause with “substantial meaning.” Brief
for Petitioner 32.
   With the statutory definition incorporated, clause (iii)
protects a whistleblower who reports misconduct both to
the SEC and to another entity, but suffers retaliation
because of the latter, non-SEC, disclosure. That would be
so, for example, where the retaliating employer is un-
aware that the employee has alerted the SEC. In such a
case, without clause (iii), retaliation for internal reporting
would not be reached by Dodd-Frank, for clause (i) applies
only where the employer retaliates against the employee
“because of ” the SEC reporting. §78u–6(h)(1)(A). More-
over, even where the employer knows of the SEC reporting,
the third clause may operate to dispel a proof problem:
The employee can recover under the statute without hav-
ing to demonstrate whether the retaliation was motivated
by the internal report (thus yielding protection under
clause (iii)) or by the SEC disclosure (thus gaining protec-
tion under clause (i)).
   While the Solicitor General asserts that limiting the
protections of clause (iii) to dual reporters would “shrink
to insignificance the [clause’s] ban on retaliation,” Brief for
United States as Amicus Curiae 22 (internal quotation
marks omitted), he offers scant evidence to support that
assertion. Tugging in the opposite direction, he reports
that approximately 80 percent of the whistleblowers who
received awards in 2016 “reported internally before report-

not be absurd to apply the “whistleblower” definition to the anti-
retaliation provision. Tr. of Oral Arg. 52.

ing to the Commission.” Id., at 23. And Digital Realty
cites real-world examples of dual reporters seeking Dodd-
Frank or Sarbanes-Oxley recovery for alleged retaliation.
See Brief for Petitioner 33, and n. 4 (collecting cases).
Overlooked by Somers and the Solicitor General, in dual-
reporting cases, retaliation not prompted by SEC disclo-
sures (and thus unaddressed by clause (i)) is likely com-
monplace: The SEC is required to protect the identity of
whistleblowers, see §78u–6(h)(2)(A), so employers will
often be unaware that an employee has reported to the
Commission. In any event, even if the number of individ-
uals qualifying for protection under clause (iii) is relatively
limited, “[i]t is our function to give the statute the effect
its language suggests, however modest that may be.”

                              B
   Somers and the Solicitor General express concern that
our reading would jettison protection for auditors, attor-
neys, and other employees subject to internal-reporting
requirements. See Brief for Respondent 35; Brief for
United States as Amicus Curiae 21. Sarbanes-Oxley, for
example, requires auditors and attorneys to report certain
information within the company before making disclosures
externally. See </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">15</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §§78j–1(b), 7245; 17 CFR
§205.3. If the whistleblower definition applies, Somers
and the Solicitor General fear, these professionals will be
“le[ft] . . . vulnerable to discharge or other retaliatory
action for complying with” their internal-reporting obliga-
tions. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 22 (inter-
nal quotation marks omitted).
   Our reading shields employees in these circumstances,
however, as soon as they also provide relevant information
to the Commission. True, such employees will remain
ineligible for Dodd-Frank’s protection until they tell the
16          DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. v. SOMERS

                      Opinion of the Court

SEC, but this result is consistent with Congress’ aim to
encourage SEC disclosures. See S. Rep. No. 111–176, at
38; supra, at 3–4, 11. Somers worries that lawyers and
auditors will face retaliation quickly, before they have a
chance to report to the SEC. Brief for Respondent 35–36.
But he offers nothing to show that Congress had this
concern in mind when it enacted §78u–6(h). Indeed, Con-
gress may well have considered adequate the safeguards
already afforded by Sarbanes-Oxley, protections specifi-
cally designed to shield lawyers, accountants, and similar
professionals. See Lawson, 571 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,
at 17).
                              C
   Applying the whistleblower definition as written, Som-
ers and the Solicitor General further protest, will create
“an incredibly unusual statutory scheme”: “[I]dentical
misconduct”—i.e., retaliating against an employee for
internal reporting—will “go punished or not based on the
happenstance of a separate report” to the SEC, of which
the wrongdoer may “not even be aware.” Brief for Re-
spondent 37–38. See also Brief for United States as Ami-
cus Curiae 24. The upshot, the Solicitor General warns,
“would [be] substantially diminish[ed] Dodd-Fran[k] de-
terrent effect.” Ibid.
   Overlooked in this protest is Dodd-Frank’s core objec-
tive: to prompt reporting to the SEC. Supra, at 3–4, 11.
In view of that precise aim, it is understandable that the
statute’s retaliation protections, like its financial rewards,
would be reserved for employees who have done what
Dodd-Frank seeks to achieve, i.e., they have placed infor-
mation about unlawful activity before the Commission to
aid its enforcement efforts.
                             D
     Pointing to another purported anomaly attending the
                 Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)           17

                     Opinion of the Court

reading we adopt today, the Solicitor General observes
that neither the whistleblower definition nor §78u–6(h)
contains any requirement of a “temporal or topical connec-
tion between the violation reported to the Commission and
the internal disclosure for which the employee suffers
retaliation.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 25.
It is therefore possible, the Solicitor General posits, that
“an employee who was fired for reporting accounting fraud
to his supervisor in 2017 would have a cause of action
under [§78u–6(h)] if he had reported an insider-trading
violation by his previous employer to the Commission in
2012.” Ibid. For its part, Digital Realty agrees that this
scenario could arise, but does not see it as a cause for
concern: “Congress,” it states, “could reasonably have
made the policy judgment that individuals who report
securities-law violations to the SEC should receive broad
protection over time against retaliation for a variety of
disclosures.” Reply Brief 11.
   We need not dwell on the situation hypothesized by the
Solicitor General, for it veers far from the case before us.
We note, however, that the interpretation offered by Som-
ers and the Solicitor General—i.e., ignoring the statutory
definition when construing the anti-retaliation provision—
raises an even thornier question about the law’s scope.
Their view, which would not require an employee to pro-
vide information relating to a securities-law violation to
the SEC, could afford Dodd-Frank protection to an em-
ployee who reports information bearing no relationship
whatever to the securities laws. That prospect could be
imagined based on the broad array of federal statutes and
regulations cross-referenced by clause (iii) of the anti-
retaliation provision. E.g., </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">18</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §1513(e) (criminal-

would make scant sense, however, to rank an FBI drug-
trafficking informant a whistleblower under Dodd-Frank,
a law concerned only with encouraging the reporting of
“securities law violations.” S. Rep. No. 111–176, at 38
(emphasis added).
                              E
   Finally, the interpretation we adopt, the Solicitor Gen-
eral adds, would undermine not just clause (iii) of §78u–
6(h)(1)(A), but clause (ii) as well. Clause (ii) prohibits
retaliation against a whistleblower for “initiating, testify-
ing in, or assisting in any investigation or . . . action of the
Commission based upon” information conveyed to the SEC
by a whistleblower in accordance with the statute. §78u–
6(h)(1)(A)(ii). If the whistleblower definition is applied to
§78u–6(h), the Solicitor General states, “an employer could
fire an employee for giving . . . testimony [to the SEC] if
the employee had not previously reported to the Commis-
sion online or through the specified written form”—i.e., the
methods currently prescribed by Rule 21F–9 for a whistle-
blower to provide information to the Commission. Brief
for United States as Amicus Curiae 20–21 (citing 17 CFR
§240.21F–9(a)(1)–(2)).
   But the statute expressly delegates authority to the SEC
to establish the “manner” in which information may be
provided to the Commission by a whistleblower. See
§78u–6(a)(6). Nothing in today’s opinion prevents the
agency from enumerating additional means of SEC report-
ing—including through testimony protected by clause (ii).
                            IV
   For the foregoing reasons, we find the statute’s defini-
tion of “whistleblower” clear and conclusive. Because
“Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at

ence to the contrary view advanced by the SEC in Rule
21F–2. See 17 CFR §240.21F–2(b)(1); supra, at 6–7. The
statute’s unambiguous whistleblower definition, in short,
precludes the Commission from more expansively inter-
preting that term. See Burgess, 553 U. S., at 130.

            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

                      [February 21, 2018]


   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE BREYER joins,
concurring.
   I join the Court’s opinion in full. I write separately only
to note my disagreement with the suggestion in my col-
league’s concurrence that a Senate Report is not an appro-
priate source for this Court to consider when interpreting
a statute.
   Legislative history is of course not the law, but that does
not mean it cannot aid us in our understanding of a law.
Just as courts are capable of assessing the reliability and
utility of evidence generally, they are capable of assessing
the reliability and utility of legislative-history materials.
   Committee reports, like the Senate Report the Court
discusses here, see ante, at 3–4, 11–12, 16–18, are a par-
ticularly reliable source to which we can look to ensure our
fidelity to Congress’ intended meaning. See Garcia v.
United States, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">469</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">70</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 76 (1984) (“In surveying legis-
lative history we have repeatedly stated that the authori-
tative source for finding the Legislature’s intent lies in the

considered and collective understanding of those Con-

legislation’ ” (quoting Zuber v. Allen, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">396</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">168</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 186
(1969))). Bills presented to Congress for consideration are
generally accompanied by a committee report. Such re-

ports are typically circulated at least two days before a bill
is to be considered on the floor and provide Members of
Congress and their staffs with information about “a bill’s
context, purposes, policy implications, and details,” along
with information on its supporters and opponents. R.

LaRue, Senate Manual Containing the Standing Rules,
Orders, Laws, and Resolutions Affecting the Business of
the United States Senate, S. Doc. No. 107–1, p. 17 (2001)).
These materials “have long been important means of
informing the whole chamber about proposed legislation,”
Katzmann, Judging Statutes, at 19, a point Members
themselves have emphasized over the years.* It is thus no
surprise that legislative staffers view committee and
conference reports as the most reliable type of legislative
history. See Gluck & Bressman, Statutory Interpretation

statute is ambiguous or deals with especially complex
matters. But even when, as here, a statute’s meaning can
clearly be discerned from its text, consulting reliable
legislative history can still be useful, as it enables us to
corroborate and fortify our understanding of the text. See,
e.g., Tapia v. United States, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""218921""><a href=""/opinion/218921/tapia-v-united-states/""><span class=""volume"">564</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">319</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 331–332 (2011);

Moreover, confirming our construction of a statute by
considering reliable legislative history shows respect for
and promotes comity with a coequal branch of Govern-
ment. See Katzmann, Judging Statutes, at 35–36.
   For these reasons, I do not think it wise for judges to
close their eyes to reliable legislative history—and the
realities of how Members of Congress create and enact
laws—when it is available.

            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

                        [February 21, 2018]


   JUSTICE THOMAS, with whom JUSTICE ALITO and
JUSTICE GORSUCH join, concurring in part and concurring
in the judgment.
   I join the Court’s opinion only to the extent it relies on
the text of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Con-
sumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank), 124 Stat. 1376. The
question in this case is whether the term “whistleblower”
in Dodd-Frank’s antiretaliation provision, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">15</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">.
§78u–6(h)(1), includes a person who does not report infor-
mation to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The
answer is in the definitions section of the statute, which
states that the term “whistleblower” means a person who
provides “information relating to a violation of the securi-
ties laws to the Commission.” §78u–6(a)(6). As the Court
observes, this statutory definition “resolves the question
before us.” Ante, at 9. The Court goes on, however, to
discuss the supposed “purpose” of the statute, which it
primarily derives from a single Senate Report. See ante,
at 3–4, 11–12, 16–18. Even assuming a majority of Con-
gress read the Senate Report, agreed with it, and voted for
Dodd-Frank with the same intent, “we are a government
of laws, not of men, and are governed by what Congress
enacted rather than by what it intended.”* Lawson v.

“particularly reliable source” for discerning “Congress’ intended mean-
ing.” Ante, at 1 (SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring). The following exchange
on the Senate floor is telling:

or not he wrote the committee report?
    “Mr. DOLE. Did I write the committee report?
    “Mr. ARMSTRONG. Yes.
    “Mr. DOLE. No; the Senator from Kansas did not write the com-

    “Mr. ARMSTRONG. Does the Senator know of any Senator who
wrote the committee report?
    “Mr. DOLE. I might be able to identify one, but I would have to
search. I was here all during the time it was written, I might say, and
worked carefully with the staff as they worked. . . .
    “Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. President, has the Senator from Kansas,
the chairman of the Finance Committee, read the committee report in
its entirety?
    “Mr. DOLE. I am working on it. It is not a bestseller, but I am work-
ing on it.
    “Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. President, did members of the Finance
Committee vote on the committee report?
    “Mr. DOLE. No.
    “Mr. ARMSTRONG. . . . The report itself is not considered by the

the Senator from Colorado or even by a majority of all Senators, there
would be no way for us to change the report. I could not offer an
amendment tonight to amend the committee report. . . . [ L]et me just

          DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. v. SOMERS

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT

No. 16–1276. Argued November 28, 2017—Decided February 21, 2018
Endeavoring to root out corporate fraud, Congress passed the Sar-
 banes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley) and the 2010 Dodd-Frank
 Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank).
 Both Acts shield whistleblowers from retaliation, but they differ in
 important respects. Sarbanes-Oxley applies to all “employees” who
 report misconduct to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC
 or Commission), any other federal agency, Congress, or an internal
 supervisor. 18 U. S. C. §1514A(a)(1). Dodd-Frank defines a “whistle-
 blower” as “any individual who provides . . . information relating to a
 violation of the securities laws to the Commission, in a manner estab-
 lished, by rule or regulation, by the Commission.” 15 U. S. C. §78u–
 6(a)(6). A whistleblower so defined is eligible for an award if original
 information provided to the SEC leads to a successful enforcement
 action. §78u–6(b)–(g). And he or she is protected from retaliation in
 three situations, see §78u–6(h)(1)(A)(i)–(iii), including for “making
 disclosures that are required or protected under” Sarbanes-Oxley or
 other specified laws, §78u–6(h)(1)(A)(iii). Sarbanes-Oxley’s anti-
 retaliation provision contains an administrative-exhaustion require-
 ment and a 180-day administrative complaint-filing deadline, see 18
 U. S. C. §1514A(b)(1)(A), (2)(D), whereas Dodd-Frank permits a whis-
 tleblower to sue an employer directly in federal district court, with a
 default six-year limitation period, see §78u–6(h)(1)(B)(i), (iii)(I)(aa).
    The SEC’s regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank provision
 contain two discrete whistleblower definitions. For purposes of the
 award program, Rule 21F–2 requires a whistleblower to “provide the
 Commission with information” relating to possible securities-law vio-
 lations. 17 CFR §240.21F–2(a)(1). For purposes of the anti-
 retaliation protections, however, the Rule does not require SEC re-
2             DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. v. SOMERS

                                 Syllabus

    porting. See §240.21F–2(b)(1)(i)–(ii).
      Respondent Paul Somers alleges that petitioner Digital Realty
    Trust, Inc. (Digital Realty) terminated his employment shortly after
    he reported to senior management suspected securities-law violations
    by the company. Somers filed suit, alleging, inter alia, a claim of
    whistleblower retaliation under Dodd-Frank. Digital Realty moved
    to dismiss that claim on the ground that Somers was not a whistle-
    blower under §78u–6(h) because he did not alert the SEC prior to his
    termination. The District Court denied the motion, and the Ninth
    Circuit affirmed. The Court of Appeals concluded that §78u–6(h)
    does not necessitate recourse to the SEC prior to gaining “whistle-
    blower” status, and it accorded deference to the SEC’s regulation un-
    der Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,
    467 U. S. 837.
Held: Dodd-Frank’s anti-retaliation provision does not extend to an
 individual, like Somers, who has not reported a violation of the secu-
 rities laws to the SEC. Pp. 9–19.
    (a) A statute’s explicit definition must be followed, even if it varies
 from a term’s ordinary meaning. Burgess v. United States, 553 U. S.
 124, 130. Section 78u–6(a) instructs that the statute’s definition of
 “whistleblower” “shall apply” “[i]n this section,” that is, throughout
 §78u–6. The Court must therefore interpret the term “whistleblower”
 in §78u–6(h), the anti-retaliation provision, in accordance with that
 definition.
    The whistleblower definition operates in conjunction with the three
 clauses of §78u–6(h)(1)(A) to spell out the provision’s scope. The def-
 inition first describes who is eligible for protection—namely, a “whis-
 tleblower” who provides pertinent information “to the Commission.”
 §78u–6(a)(6). The three clauses then describe what conduct, when
 engaged in by a “whistleblower,” is shielded from employment dis-
 crimination. An individual who meets both measures may invoke
 Dodd-Frank’s protections. But an individual who falls outside the
 protected category of “whistleblowers” is ineligible to seek redress
 under the statute, regardless of the conduct in which that individual
 engages. This reading is reinforced by another whistleblower-
 protection provision in Dodd-Frank, see 12 U. S. C. §5567(b), which
 imposes no requirement that information be conveyed to a govern-
 ment agency. Pp. 9–11.
    (b) The Court’s understanding is corroborated by Dodd-Frank’s
 purpose and design. The core objective of Dodd-Frank’s whistleblow-
 er program is to aid the Commission’s enforcement efforts by “moti-
 vat[ing] people who know of securities law violations to tell the SEC.”
 S. Rep. No. 111–176, p. 38 (emphasis added). To that end, Congress
 provided monetary awards to whistleblowers who furnish actionable
                    Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)                      3

                               Syllabus

information to the Commission. Congress also complemented the fi-
nancial incentives for SEC reporting by heightening protection
against retaliation. Pp. 11–12.
   (c) Somers and the Solicitor General contend that Dodd-Frank’s
“whistleblower” definition applies only to the statute’s award pro-
gram and not, as the definition plainly states, to its anti-retaliation
provision. Their concerns do not support a departure from the statu-
tory text. Pp. 12–18.
      (1) They claim that the Court’s reading would vitiate the protec-
tions of clause (iii) for whistleblowers who make disclosures to per-
sons and entities other than the SEC. See §78u–6(h)(1)(A)(iii). But
the plain-text reading of the statute leaves the third clause with sub-
stantial meaning by protecting a whistleblower who reports miscon-
duct both to the SEC and to another entity, but suffers retaliation be-
cause of the latter, non-SEC, disclosure. Pp. 13–15.
      (2) Nor would the Court’s reading jettison protections for audi-
tors, attorneys, and other employees who are required to report in-
formation within the company before making external disclosures.
Such employees would be shielded as soon as they also provide rele-
vant information to the Commission. And Congress may well have
considered adequate the safeguards already afforded to such employ-
ees by Sarbanes-Oxley. Pp. 15–16.
      (3) Applying the “whistleblower” definition as written, Somers
and the Solicitor General further protest, will allow “identical mis-
conduct” to “go punished or not based on the happenstance of a sepa-
rate report” to the SEC. Brief for Respondent 37–38. But it is under-
standable that the statute’s retaliation protections, like its financial
rewards, would be reserved for employees who have done what Dodd-
Frank seeks to achieve by reporting information about unlawful ac-
tivity to the SEC. P. 16.
      (4) The Solicitor General observes that the statute contains no
apparent requirement of a “temporal or topical connection between
the violation reported to the Commission and the internal disclosure
for which the employee suffers retaliation.” Brief for United States
as Amicus Curiae 25. The Court need not dwell on related hypotheti-
cals, which veer far from the case at hand. Pp. 16–18.
      (5) Finally, the interpretation adopted here would not undermine
clause (ii) of §78u–6(h)(1)(A), which prohibits retaliation against a
whistleblower for “initiating, testifying in, or assisting in any investi-
gation or . . . action of the Commission based upon” information con-
veyed to the SEC by a whistleblower in accordance with the statute.
The statute delegates authority to the Commission to establish the
“manner” in which a whistleblower may provide information to the
SEC. §78u–6(a)(6). Nothing prevents the Commission from enumer-
4              DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. v. SOMERS

                                  Syllabus

    ating additional means of SEC reporting, including through testimo-
    ny protected by clause (ii). P. 18.
      (d) Because “Congress has directly spoken to the precise question
    at issue,” Chevron, 467 U. S., at 842, deference is not accorded to the
    contrary view advanced by the SEC in Rule 21F–2. Pp. 18–19.

   DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC., PETITIONER v.

                PAUL SOMERS 

 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

                              [February 21, 2018]


   JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.
   Endeavoring to root out corporate fraud, Congress
passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 116 Stat. 745
(Sarbanes-Oxley), and the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act, 124 Stat. 1376
(Dodd-Frank).      Both Acts shield whistleblowers from
retaliation, but they differ in important respects. Most
notably, Sarbanes-Oxley applies to all “employees” who
report misconduct to the Securities and Exchange Com-
mission (SEC or Commission), any other federal agency,
Congress, or an internal supervisor.             18 U. S. C.
§1514A(a)(1). Dodd-Frank delineates a more circum-
scribed class; it defines “whistleblower” to mean a person
who provides “information relating to a violation of the
securities laws to the Commission.” 15 U. S. C. §78u–
6(a)(6). A whistleblower so defined is eligible for an award
if original information he or she provides to the SEC leads
to a successful enforcement action. §78u–6(b)–(g). And,
most relevant here, a whistleblower is protected from
retaliation for, inter alia, “making disclosures that are
required or protected under” Sarbanes-Oxley, the Securi-
2          DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. v. SOMERS

                     Opinion of the Court

ties Exchange Act of 1934, the criminal anti-retaliation
proscription at 18 U. S. C. §1513(e), or any other
law subject to the SEC’s jurisdiction.           15 U. S. C.
§78u–6(h)(1)(A)(iii).
   The question presented: Does the anti-retaliation provi-
sion of Dodd-Frank extend to an individual who has not
reported a violation of the securities laws to the SEC and
therefore falls outside the Act’s definition of “whistleblow-
er”? Pet. for Cert. (I). We answer that question “No”: To
sue under Dodd-Frank’s anti-retaliation provision, a per-
son must first “provid[e] . . . information relating to a
violation of the securities laws to the Commission.”
§78u–6(a)(6).
                             I

                            A

  “To safeguard investors in public companies and restore
trust in the financial markets following the collapse of
Enron Corporation,” Congress enacted Sarbanes-Oxley in
2002. Lawson v. FMR LLC, 571 U. S. 429, ___ (2014) (slip
op., at 1). Most pertinent here, Sarbanes-Oxley created
new protections for employees at risk of retaliation for
reporting corporate misconduct. See 18 U. S. C. §1514A.
Section 1514A prohibits certain companies from discharg-
ing or otherwise “discriminat[ing] against an employee in
the terms and conditions of employment because” the
employee “provid[es] information . . . or otherwise assist[s]
in an investigation regarding any conduct which the em-
ployee reasonably believes constitutes a violation” of cer-
tain criminal fraud statutes, any SEC rule or regulation,
or “any provision of Federal law relating to fraud against
shareholders.” §1514A(a)(1). An employee qualifies for
protection when he or she provides information or assis-
tance either to a federal regulatory or law enforcement
agency, Congress, or any “person with supervisory author-
                      Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)                      3

ity over the employee.” §1514A(a)(1)(A)–(C).1
   To recover under §1514A, an aggrieved employee must
exhaust administrative remedies by “filing a complaint
with the Secretary of Labor.” §1514A(b)(1)(A); see Law-
son, 571 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 5–6). Congress
prescribed a 180-day limitation period for filing such a
complaint. §1514A(b)(2)(D). If the agency “does not issue
a final decision within 180 days of the filing of [a] com-
plaint, and the [agency’s] delay is not due to bad faith on
the claimant’s part, the claimant may proceed to federal
district court for de novo review.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6)
(citing §1514A(b)). An employee who prevails in a pro-
ceeding under §1514A is “entitled to all relief necessary to
make the employee whole,” including reinstatement,
backpay with interest, and any “special damages sus-
tained as a result of the discrimination,” among such
damages, litigation costs. §1514A(c).

                              1
   At issue in this case is the Dodd-Frank anti-retaliation
provision enacted in 2010, eight years after the enactment
of Sarbanes-Oxley. Passed in the wake of the 2008 finan-
cial crisis, Dodd-Frank aimed to “promote the financial
stability of the United States by improving accountability
and transparency in the financial system.” 124 Stat. 1376.
   Dodd-Frank responded to numerous perceived short-
comings in financial regulation. Among them was the
SEC’s need for additional “power, assistance and money at
its disposal” to regulate securities markets. S. Rep. No.
111–176, pp. 36, 37 (2010). To assist the Commission “in

   1 Sarbanes-Oxley also prohibits retaliation against an “employee” who

“file[s], . . . testif[ies], participate[s] in, or otherwise assist[s] in a
proceeding filed or about to be filed . . . relating to an alleged violation
of” the same provisions of federal law addressed in 18 U. S. C.
§1514A(a)(1). See §1514A(a)(2).
4          DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. v. SOMERS

                      Opinion of the Court

identifying securities law violations,” the Act established
“a new, robust whistleblower program designed to moti-
vate people who know of securities law violations to tell
the SEC.” Id., at 38. And recognizing that “whistleblow-
ers often face the difficult choice between telling the truth
and . . . committing ‘career suicide,’ ” Congress sought to
protect whistleblowers from employment discrimination.
Id., at 111, 112.
   Dodd-Frank implemented these goals by adding a new
provision to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934: 15
U. S. C. §78u–6. Section 78u–6 begins by defining a
“whistleblower” as “any individual who provides . . . in-
formation relating to a violation of the securities laws to
the Commission, in a manner established, by rule or regu-
lation, by the Commission.”          §78u–6(a)(6) (emphasis
added). That definition, the statute directs, “shall apply”
“[i]n this section”—i.e., throughout §78u–6. §78u–6(a).
   Section 78u–6 affords covered whistleblowers both
incentives and protection. First, the section creates an
award program for “whistleblowers who voluntarily
provid[e] original information to the Commission that
le[ads] to the successful enforcement of [a] covered judicial
or administrative action.” §78u–6(b)(1). A qualifying
whistleblower is entitled to a cash award of 10 to 30 per-
cent of the monetary sanctions collected in the enforce-
ment action. See §78u–6(b)(1)(A)–(B).
   Second, §78u–6(h) prohibits an employer from discharg-
ing, harassing, or otherwise discriminating against a
“whistleblower” “because of any lawful act done by the
whistleblower” in three situations: first, “in providing
information to the Commission in accordance with [§78u–
6],” §78u–6(h)(1)(A)(i); second, “in initiating, testifying in,
or assisting in any investigation or . . . action of the Com-
mission based upon” information provided to the SEC in
accordance with §78u–6, §78u–6(h)(1)(A)(ii); and third, “in
making disclosures that are required or protected under”

                          Opinion of the Court

either Sarbanes-Oxley, the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, the criminal anti-retaliation prohibition at 18
U. S. C. §1513(e),2 or “any other law, rule, or regulation
subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission,” §78u–
6(h)(1)(A)(iii). Clause (iii), by cross-referencing Sarbanes-
Oxley and other laws, protects disclosures made to a
variety of individuals and entities in addition to the SEC.
For example, the clause shields an employee’s reports of
wrongdoing to an internal supervisor if the reports are
independently safeguarded from retaliation under Sarbanes-
Oxley. See supra, at 2–3.3
  The recovery procedures under the anti-retaliation
provisions of Dodd-Frank and Sarbanes-Oxley differ in
critical respects. First, unlike Sarbanes-Oxley, which
contains an administrative-exhaustion requirement and a
180-day administrative complaint-filing deadline, see 18
U. S. C. §1514A(b)(1)(A), (2)(D), Dodd-Frank permits a
whistleblower to sue a current or former employer directly
——————
  2 Section   1513(e) provides: “Whoever knowingly, with the intent to
retaliate, takes any action harmful to any person, including interfer-
ence with the lawful employment or livelihood of any person, for provid-
ing to a law enforcement officer any truthful information relating to the
commission or possible commission of any Federal offense, shall be
fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.”
   3 Section 78u–6(h)(1)(A) reads in full:

   “No employer may discharge, demote, suspend, threaten, harass,
directly or indirectly, or in any other manner discriminate against, a
whistleblower in the terms and conditions of employment because of
any lawful act done by the whistleblower—
   “(i) in providing information to the Commission in accordance with
this section;
   “(ii) in initiating, testifying in, or assisting in any investigation or
judicial or administrative action of the Commission based upon or
related to such information; or
   “(iii) in making disclosures that are required or protected under the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (15 U. S. C. §7201 et seq.), this chapter,
including section 78j–l(m) of this title, section 1513(e) of title 18, and
any other law, rule, or regulation subject to the jurisdiction of the
Commission.”
6              DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. v. SOMERS

                        Opinion of the Court

in federal district court, with a default limitation period of
six years, see §78u–6(h)(1)(B)(i), (iii)(I)(aa). Second, Dodd-
Frank instructs a court to award to a prevailing plaintiff
double backpay with interest, see §78u–6(h)(1)(C)(ii),
while Sarbanes-Oxley limits recovery to actual backpay
with interest, see 18 U. S. C. §1514A(c)(2)(B). Like Sarbanes-
Oxley, however, Dodd-Frank authorizes reinstatement
and compensation for litigation costs, expert witness fees,
and reasonable attorneys’ fees.               Compare §78u–
6(h)(1)(C)(i), (iii), with 18 U. S. C. §1514A(c)(2)(A), (C).4
                              2
   Congress authorized the SEC “to issue such rules and
regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to imple-
ment the provisions of [§78u–6] consistent with the pur-
poses of this section.” §78u–6(j). Pursuant to this author-
ity, the SEC published a notice of proposed rulemaking to
“Implemen[t] the Whistleblower Provisions” of Dodd-
Frank. 75 Fed. Reg. 70488 (2010). Proposed Rule 21F–
2(a) defined a “whistleblower,” for purposes of both the
award and anti-retaliation provisions of §78u–6, as one or
more individuals who “provide the Commission with in-
formation relating to a potential violation of the securities
laws.” Id., at 70519 (proposed 17 CFR §240.21F–2(a)).
The proposed rule, the agency noted, “tracks the statutory
definition of a ‘whistleblower’ ” by requiring information
reporting to the SEC itself. 75 Fed. Reg. 70489.
   In promulgating the final Rule, however, the agency
changed course. Rule 21F–2, in finished form, contains
two discrete “whistleblower” definitions. See 17 CFR
§240.21F–2(a)–(b) (2017). For purposes of the award
program, the Rule states that “[y]ou are a whistleblower if
——————
    4 Unlike
          Dodd-Frank, Sarbanes-Oxley explicitly entitles a prevailing
employee to “all relief necessary to make the employee whole,” includ-
ing “compensation for any special damages sustained as a result of the
discrimination.” 18 U. S. C. §1514A(c)(1), (2)(C).

                          Opinion of the Court

. . . you provide the Commission with information . . .
relat[ing] to a possible violation of the Federal securities
laws.” §240.21F–2(a)(1) (emphasis added). The infor-
mation must be provided to the SEC through its website
or by mailing or faxing a specified form to the SEC Office
of the Whistleblower. See ibid.; §240.21F–9(a)(1)–(2).
    “For purposes of the anti-retaliation protections,” how-
ever, the Rule states that “[y]ou are a whistleblower if . . .
[y]ou possess a reasonable belief that the information you
are providing relates to a possible securities law violation”
and “[y]ou provide that information in a manner described
in” clauses (i) through (iii) of §78u–6(h)(1)(A). 17 CFR
§240.21F–2(b)(1)(i)–(ii). “The anti-retaliation protections
apply,” the Rule emphasizes, “whether or not you satisfy
the requirements, procedures and conditions to qualify for
an award.” §240.21F–2(b)(1)(iii). An individual may
therefore gain anti-retaliation protection as a “whistle-
blower” under Rule 21F–2 without providing information
to the SEC, so long as he or she provides information in a
manner shielded by one of the anti-retaliation provision’s
three clauses. For example, a report to a company super-
visor would qualify if the report garners protection under
the Sarbanes-Oxley anti-retaliation provision.5
                             C
  Petitioner Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (Digital Realty) is a
real estate investment trust that owns, acquires, and
develops data centers. See Brief for Petitioner 3. Digital
Realty employed respondent Paul Somers as a Vice Presi-
dent from 2010 to 2014. See 119 F. Supp. 3d 1088, 1092
(ND Cal. 2015). Somers alleges that Digital Realty termi-
nated him shortly after he reported to senior management
suspected securities-law violations by the company. See
——————
  5 In 2015, the SEC issued an interpretive rule reiterating that anti-

retaliation protection is not contingent on a whistleblower’s provision of
information to the Commission. See 80 Fed. Reg. 47829 (2015).
8          DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. v. SOMERS

                     Opinion of the Court

ibid. Although nothing impeded him from alerting the
SEC prior to his termination, he did not do so. See Tr. of
Oral Arg. 45. Nor did he file an administrative complaint
within 180 days of his termination, rendering him ineligi-
ble for relief under Sarbanes-Oxley. See ibid.; 18 U. S. C.
§1514A(b)(2)(D).
   Somers brought suit in the United States District Court
for the Northern District of California alleging, inter alia,
a claim of whistleblower retaliation under Dodd-Frank.
Digital Realty moved to dismiss that claim, arguing that
“Somers does not qualify as a ‘whistleblower’ under [§78u–
6(h)] because he did not report any alleged law violations
to the SEC.” 119 F. Supp. 3d, at 1094. The District Court
denied the motion. Rule 21F–2, the court observed, does
not necessitate recourse to the SEC prior to gaining “whis-
tleblower” status under Dodd-Frank. See id., at 1095–
1096. Finding the statutory scheme ambiguous, the court
accorded deference to the SEC’s Rule under Chevron
U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,
467 U. S. 837 (1984). See 119 F. Supp. 3d, at 1096–1106.
   On interlocutory appeal, a divided panel of the Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. 850 F. 3d 1045
(2017). The majority acknowledged that Dodd-Frank’s
definitional provision describes a “whistleblower” as an
individual who provides information to the SEC itself. Id.,
at 1049.      But applying that definition to the anti-
retaliation provision, the majority reasoned, would narrow
the third clause of §78u–6(h)(1)(A) “to the point of absurd-
ity”: The statute would protect employees only if they
“reported possible securities violations both internally and
to the SEC.” Ibid. Such dual reporting, the majority
believed, was unlikely to occur. Ibid. Therefore, the
majority concluded, the statute should be read to protect
employees who make disclosures privileged by clause (iii)
of §78u–6(h)(1)(A), whether or not those employees also
provide information to the SEC. Id., at 1050. In any

                      Opinion of the Court

event, the majority held, the SEC’s resolution of any stat-
utory ambiguity warranted deference. Ibid. Judge Owens
dissented. In his view, the statutory definition of whistle-
blower was clear, left no room for interpretation, and
plainly governed. Id., at 1051.
   Two other Courts of Appeals have weighed in on the
question before us. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth
Circuit has held that employees must provide information
to the SEC to avail themselves of Dodd-Frank’s anti-
retaliation safeguard. See Asadi v. G. E. Energy (USA),
L. L. C., 720 F. 3d 620, 630 (2013). A divided panel of the
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reached the oppo-
site conclusion, over a dissent by Judge Jacobs. See Ber-
man v. NEO@OGILVY LLC, 801 F. 3d 145, 155 (2013).
We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict, 582 U. S. ___
(2017), and now reverse the Ninth Circuit’s judgment.
                             II
   “When a statute includes an explicit definition, we must
follow that definition,” even if it varies from a term’s
ordinary meaning. Burgess v. United States, 553 U. S.
124, 130 (2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). This
principle resolves the question before us.
                               A
   Our charge in this review proceeding is to determine the
meaning of “whistleblower” in §78u–6(h), Dodd-Frank’s
anti-retaliation provision. The definition section of the
statute supplies an unequivocal answer: A “whistleblower”
is “any individual who provides . . . information relating to
a violation of the securities laws to the Commission.”
§78u–6(a)(6) (emphasis added). Leaving no doubt as to
the definition’s reach, the statute instructs that the “defi-
nitio[n] shall apply” “[i]n this section,” that is, throughout
§78u–6. §78u–6(a)(6).
   The whistleblower definition operates in conjunction
10         DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. v. SOMERS

                      Opinion of the Court

with the three clauses of §78u–6(h)(1)(A) to spell out the
provision’s scope. The definition first describes who is
eligible for protection—namely, a whistleblower who
provides pertinent information “to the Commission.”
§78u–6(a)(6). The three clauses of §78u–6(h)(1)(A) then
describe what conduct, when engaged in by a whistle-
blower, is shielded from employment discrimination. See
§78u–6(h)(1)(A)(i)–(iii). An individual who meets both
measures may invoke Dodd-Frank’s protections. But an
individual who falls outside the protected category of
“whistleblowers” is ineligible to seek redress under the
statute, regardless of the conduct in which that individual
engages.
   Reinforcing our reading, another whistleblower-
protection provision in Dodd-Frank imposes no require-
ment that information be conveyed to a government agency.
Title 10 of the statute, which created the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), prohibits discrimina-
tion against a “covered employee” who, among other
things, “provide[s] . . . information to [his or her] employer,
the Bureau, or any other State, local, or Federal, govern-
ment authority or law enforcement agency relating to” a
violation of a law subject to the CFPB’s jurisdiction. 12
U. S. C. §5567(a)(1). To qualify as a “covered employee,”
an individual need not provide information to the CFPB,
or any other entity. See §5567(b) (“covered employee”
means “any individual performing tasks related to the
offering or provision of a consumer financial product or
service”).
   “[W]hen Congress includes particular language in one
section of a statute but omits it in another[,] . . . this Court
presumes that Congress intended a difference in mean-
ing.” Loughrin v. United States, 573 U. S. ___, ___ (2014)
(slip op., at 6) (internal quotation marks and alteration
omitted). Congress placed a government-reporting re-
quirement in §78u–6(h), but not elsewhere in the same

                     Opinion of the Court

statute. Courts are not at liberty to dispense with the
condition—tell the SEC—Congress imposed.
                              B
  Dodd-Frank’s purpose and design corroborate our com-
prehension of §78u–6(h)’s reporting requirement. The
“core objective” of Dodd-Frank’s robust whistleblower
program, as Somers acknowledges, Tr. of Oral Arg. 45, is
“to motivate people who know of securities law violations
to tell the SEC,” S. Rep. No. 111–176, at 38 (emphasis
added). By enlisting whistleblowers to “assist the Gov-
ernment [in] identify[ing] and prosecut[ing] persons who
have violated securities laws,” Congress undertook to
improve SEC enforcement and facilitate the Commission’s
“recover[y] [of] money for victims of financial fraud.” Id.,
at 110. To that end, §78u–6 provides substantial mone-
tary rewards to whistleblowers who furnish actionable
information to the SEC. See §78u–6(b).
  Financial inducements alone, Congress recognized, may
be insufficient to encourage certain employees, fearful of
employer retaliation, to come forward with evidence of
wrongdoing. Congress therefore complemented the Dodd-
Frank monetary incentives for SEC reporting by heighten-
ing protection against retaliation. While Sarbanes-Oxley
contains an administrative-exhaustion requirement, a
180-day administrative complaint-filing deadline, and a
remedial scheme limited to actual damages, Dodd-Frank
provides for immediate access to federal court, a generous
statute of limitations (at least six years), and the oppor-
tunity to recover double backpay. See supra, at 5–6.
Dodd-Frank’s award program and anti-retaliation provi-
sion thus work synchronously to motivate individuals with
knowledge of illegal activity to “tell the SEC.” S. Rep. No.
111–176, at 38.
  When enacting Sarbanes-Oxley’s whistleblower regime,
in comparison, Congress had a more far-reaching objec-
12        DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. v. SOMERS

                     Opinion of the Court

tive: It sought to disturb the “corporate code of silence”
that “discourage[d] employees from reporting fraudulent
behavior not only to the proper authorities, such as the
FBI and the SEC, but even internally.” Lawson, 571 U. S.,
at ___ (slip op., at 4) (internal quotation marks omitted).
Accordingly, the Sarbanes-Oxley anti-retaliation provision
covers employees who report fraud not only to the SEC,
but also to any other federal agency, Congress, or an
internal supervisor. See 18 U. S. C. §1514A(a)(1).
                               C
   In sum, Dodd-Frank’s text and purpose leave no doubt
that the term “whistleblower” in §78u–6(h) carries the
meaning set forth in the section’s definitional provision.
The disposition of this case is therefore evident: Somers
did not provide information “to the Commission” before his
termination, §78u–6(a)(6), so he did not qualify as a “whis-
tleblower” at the time of the alleged retaliation. He is
therefore ineligible to seek relief under §78u–6(h).
                              III
  Somers and the Solicitor General tender a different view
of Dodd-Frank’s compass. The whistleblower definition,
as they see it, applies only to the statute’s award program,
not to its anti-retaliation provision, and thus not, as the
definition plainly states, throughout “this section,” §78u–
6(a). See Brief for Respondent 30; Brief for United States
as Amicus Curiae 10–11. For purposes of the anti-
retaliation provision alone, they urge us to construe the
term “whistleblower” in its “ordinary sense,” i.e., without
any SEC-reporting requirement. Brief for Respondent 18.
  Doing so, Somers and the Solicitor General contend,
would align with our precedent, specifically Lawson v.
Suwannee Fruit & S. S. Co., 336 U. S. 198 (1949), and
Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, 573 U. S. ___ (2014).
In those decisions, we declined to apply a statutory defini-
                  Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)           13

                      Opinion of the Court

tion that ostensibly governed where doing so would have
been “incompatible with . . . Congress’ regulatory scheme,”
id., at ___ (slip op., at 18) (internal quotation marks omit-
ted), or would have “destroy[ed] one of the [statute’s]
major purposes,” Suwannee Fruit, 336 U. S., at 201.
   This case is of a piece, Somers and the Solicitor General
maintain. Applying the statutory definition here, they
variously charge, would “create obvious incongruities,”
Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 19 (internal
quotation marks omitted), “produce anomalous results,”
id., at 22, “vitiate much of the [statute’s] protection,” id.,
at 20 (internal quotation marks omitted), and, as the
Court of Appeals put it, narrow clause (iii) of §78u–
6(h)(1)(A) “to the point of absurdity,” Brief for Respondent
35 (quoting 850 F. 3d, at 1049). We next address these
concerns and explain why they do not lead us to depart
from the statutory text.
                               A
   It would gut “much of the protection afforded by” the
third clause of §78u–6(h)(1)(a), Somers and the Solicitor
General urge most strenuously, to apply the whistleblower
definition to the anti-retaliation provision. Brief for United
States as Amicus Curiae 20 (internal quotation marks
omitted); Brief for Respondent 28–29. As earlier noted,
see supra, at 4–5, clause (iii) prohibits retaliation against
a “whistleblower” for “making disclosures” to various
persons and entities, including but not limited to the SEC,
to the extent those disclosures are “required or protected
under” various laws other than Dodd-Frank.              §78u–
6(h)(1)(A)(iii). Applying the statutory definition of whis-
tleblower, however, would limit clause (iii)’s protection to
“only those individuals who report to the Commission.”
Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 22.
   The plain-text reading of the statute undoubtedly
shields fewer individuals from retaliation than the alter-
14          DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. v. SOMERS

                        Opinion of the Court

native proffered by Somers and the Solicitor General. But
we do not agree that this consequence “vitiate[s]” clause
(iii)’s protection, id., at 20 (internal quotation marks omit-
ted), or ranks as “absur[d],” Brief for Respondent 35 (in-
ternal quotation marks omitted).6 In fact, our reading
leaves the third clause with “substantial meaning.” Brief
for Petitioner 32.
   With the statutory definition incorporated, clause (iii)
protects a whistleblower who reports misconduct both to
the SEC and to another entity, but suffers retaliation
because of the latter, non-SEC, disclosure. That would be
so, for example, where the retaliating employer is un-
aware that the employee has alerted the SEC. In such a
case, without clause (iii), retaliation for internal reporting
would not be reached by Dodd-Frank, for clause (i) applies
only where the employer retaliates against the employee
“because of ” the SEC reporting. §78u–6(h)(1)(A). More-
over, even where the employer knows of the SEC reporting,
the third clause may operate to dispel a proof problem:
The employee can recover under the statute without hav-
ing to demonstrate whether the retaliation was motivated
by the internal report (thus yielding protection under
clause (iii)) or by the SEC disclosure (thus gaining protec-
tion under clause (i)).
   While the Solicitor General asserts that limiting the
protections of clause (iii) to dual reporters would “shrink
to insignificance the [clause’s] ban on retaliation,” Brief for
United States as Amicus Curiae 22 (internal quotation
marks omitted), he offers scant evidence to support that
assertion. Tugging in the opposite direction, he reports
that approximately 80 percent of the whistleblowers who
received awards in 2016 “reported internally before report-

not be absurd to apply the “whistleblower” definition to the anti-
retaliation provision. Tr. of Oral Arg. 52.

ing to the Commission.” Id., at 23. And Digital Realty
cites real-world examples of dual reporters seeking Dodd-
Frank or Sarbanes-Oxley recovery for alleged retaliation.
See Brief for Petitioner 33, and n. 4 (collecting cases).
Overlooked by Somers and the Solicitor General, in dual-
reporting cases, retaliation not prompted by SEC disclo-
sures (and thus unaddressed by clause (i)) is likely com-
monplace: The SEC is required to protect the identity of
whistleblowers, see §78u–6(h)(2)(A), so employers will
often be unaware that an employee has reported to the
Commission. In any event, even if the number of individ-
uals qualifying for protection under clause (iii) is relatively
limited, “[i]t is our function to give the statute the effect
its language suggests, however modest that may be.”
Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd., 561 U. S. 247,
270 (2010).
                              B
   Somers and the Solicitor General express concern that
our reading would jettison protection for auditors, attor-
neys, and other employees subject to internal-reporting
requirements. See Brief for Respondent 35; Brief for
United States as Amicus Curiae 21. Sarbanes-Oxley, for
example, requires auditors and attorneys to report certain
information within the company before making disclosures
externally. See 15 U. S. C. §§78j–1(b), 7245; 17 CFR
§205.3. If the whistleblower definition applies, Somers
and the Solicitor General fear, these professionals will be
“le[ft] . . . vulnerable to discharge or other retaliatory
action for complying with” their internal-reporting obliga-
tions. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 22 (inter-
nal quotation marks omitted).
   Our reading shields employees in these circumstances,
however, as soon as they also provide relevant information
to the Commission. True, such employees will remain
ineligible for Dodd-Frank’s protection until they tell the
16          DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. v. SOMERS

                      Opinion of the Court

SEC, but this result is consistent with Congress’ aim to
encourage SEC disclosures. See S. Rep. No. 111–176, at
38; supra, at 3–4, 11. Somers worries that lawyers and
auditors will face retaliation quickly, before they have a
chance to report to the SEC. Brief for Respondent 35–36.
But he offers nothing to show that Congress had this
concern in mind when it enacted §78u–6(h). Indeed, Con-
gress may well have considered adequate the safeguards
already afforded by Sarbanes-Oxley, protections specifi-
cally designed to shield lawyers, accountants, and similar
professionals. See Lawson, 571 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,
at 17).
                              C
   Applying the whistleblower definition as written, Som-
ers and the Solicitor General further protest, will create
“an incredibly unusual statutory scheme”: “[I]dentical
misconduct”—i.e., retaliating against an employee for
internal reporting—will “go punished or not based on the
happenstance of a separate report” to the SEC, of which
the wrongdoer may “not even be aware.” Brief for Re-
spondent 37–38. See also Brief for United States as Ami-
cus Curiae 24. The upshot, the Solicitor General warns,
“would [be] substantially diminish[ed] Dodd-Fran[k] de-
terrent effect.” Ibid.
   Overlooked in this protest is Dodd-Frank’s core objec-
tive: to prompt reporting to the SEC. Supra, at 3–4, 11.
In view of that precise aim, it is understandable that the
statute’s retaliation protections, like its financial rewards,
would be reserved for employees who have done what
Dodd-Frank seeks to achieve, i.e., they have placed infor-
mation about unlawful activity before the Commission to
aid its enforcement efforts.
                             D
     Pointing to another purported anomaly attending the
                 Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)           17

                     Opinion of the Court

reading we adopt today, the Solicitor General observes
that neither the whistleblower definition nor §78u–6(h)
contains any requirement of a “temporal or topical connec-
tion between the violation reported to the Commission and
the internal disclosure for which the employee suffers
retaliation.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 25.
It is therefore possible, the Solicitor General posits, that
“an employee who was fired for reporting accounting fraud
to his supervisor in 2017 would have a cause of action
under [§78u–6(h)] if he had reported an insider-trading
violation by his previous employer to the Commission in
2012.” Ibid. For its part, Digital Realty agrees that this
scenario could arise, but does not see it as a cause for
concern: “Congress,” it states, “could reasonably have
made the policy judgment that individuals who report
securities-law violations to the SEC should receive broad
protection over time against retaliation for a variety of
disclosures.” Reply Brief 11.
   We need not dwell on the situation hypothesized by the
Solicitor General, for it veers far from the case before us.
We note, however, that the interpretation offered by Som-
ers and the Solicitor General—i.e., ignoring the statutory
definition when construing the anti-retaliation provision—
raises an even thornier question about the law’s scope.
Their view, which would not require an employee to pro-
vide information relating to a securities-law violation to
the SEC, could afford Dodd-Frank protection to an em-
ployee who reports information bearing no relationship
whatever to the securities laws. That prospect could be
imagined based on the broad array of federal statutes and
regulations cross-referenced by clause (iii) of the anti-
retaliation provision. E.g., 18 U. S. C. §1513(e) (criminal-
izing retaliation for “providing to a law enforcement officer
any truthful information relating to the commission . . . of
any Federal offense” (emphasis added)); see supra, at 5,
and n. 2. For example, an employee fired for reporting a
18         DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. v. SOMERS

                      Opinion of the Court

coworker’s drug dealing to the Federal Bureau of Investi-
gation might be protected. Brief for Petitioner 38. It
would make scant sense, however, to rank an FBI drug-
trafficking informant a whistleblower under Dodd-Frank,
a law concerned only with encouraging the reporting of
“securities law violations.” S. Rep. No. 111–176, at 38
(emphasis added).
                              E
   Finally, the interpretation we adopt, the Solicitor Gen-
eral adds, would undermine not just clause (iii) of §78u–
6(h)(1)(A), but clause (ii) as well. Clause (ii) prohibits
retaliation against a whistleblower for “initiating, testify-
ing in, or assisting in any investigation or . . . action of the
Commission based upon” information conveyed to the SEC
by a whistleblower in accordance with the statute. §78u–
6(h)(1)(A)(ii). If the whistleblower definition is applied to
§78u–6(h), the Solicitor General states, “an employer could
fire an employee for giving . . . testimony [to the SEC] if
the employee had not previously reported to the Commis-
sion online or through the specified written form”—i.e., the
methods currently prescribed by Rule 21F–9 for a whistle-
blower to provide information to the Commission. Brief
for United States as Amicus Curiae 20–21 (citing 17 CFR
§240.21F–9(a)(1)–(2)).
   But the statute expressly delegates authority to the SEC
to establish the “manner” in which information may be
provided to the Commission by a whistleblower. See
§78u–6(a)(6). Nothing in today’s opinion prevents the
agency from enumerating additional means of SEC report-
ing—including through testimony protected by clause (ii).
                            IV
   For the foregoing reasons, we find the statute’s defini-
tion of “whistleblower” clear and conclusive. Because
“Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at
                 Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)                 19

issue,” Chevron, 467 U. S., at 842, we do not accord defer-
ence to the contrary view advanced by the SEC in Rule
21F–2. See 17 CFR §240.21F–2(b)(1); supra, at 6–7. The
statute’s unambiguous whistleblower definition, in short,
precludes the Commission from more expansively inter-
preting that term. See Burgess, 553 U. S., at 130.

  The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion.

            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

                      [February 21, 2018]


   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE BREYER joins,
concurring.
   I join the Court’s opinion in full. I write separately only
to note my disagreement with the suggestion in my col-
league’s concurrence that a Senate Report is not an appro-
priate source for this Court to consider when interpreting
a statute.
   Legislative history is of course not the law, but that does
not mean it cannot aid us in our understanding of a law.
Just as courts are capable of assessing the reliability and
utility of evidence generally, they are capable of assessing
the reliability and utility of legislative-history materials.
   Committee reports, like the Senate Report the Court
discusses here, see ante, at 3–4, 11–12, 16–18, are a par-
ticularly reliable source to which we can look to ensure our
fidelity to Congress’ intended meaning. See Garcia v.
United States, 469 U. S. 70, 76 (1984) (“In surveying legis-
lative history we have repeatedly stated that the authori-
tative source for finding the Legislature’s intent lies in the
Committee Reports on the bill, which ‘represen[t] the
considered and collective understanding of those Con-
gressmen involved in drafting and studying proposed
legislation’ ” (quoting Zuber v. Allen, 396 U. S. 168, 186
(1969))). Bills presented to Congress for consideration are
generally accompanied by a committee report. Such re-

ports are typically circulated at least two days before a bill
is to be considered on the floor and provide Members of
Congress and their staffs with information about “a bill’s
context, purposes, policy implications, and details,” along
with information on its supporters and opponents. R.
Katzmann, Judging Statutes 20, and n. 62 (2014) (citing A.
LaRue, Senate Manual Containing the Standing Rules,
Orders, Laws, and Resolutions Affecting the Business of
the United States Senate, S. Doc. No. 107–1, p. 17 (2001)).
These materials “have long been important means of
informing the whole chamber about proposed legislation,”
Katzmann, Judging Statutes, at 19, a point Members
themselves have emphasized over the years.* It is thus no
surprise that legislative staffers view committee and
conference reports as the most reliable type of legislative
history. See Gluck & Bressman, Statutory Interpretation
From the Inside—An Empirical Study of Congressional
Drafting, Delegation and the Canons: Part I, 65 Stan.
L. Rev. 901, 977 (2013).

statute is ambiguous or deals with especially complex
matters. But even when, as here, a statute’s meaning can
clearly be discerned from its text, consulting reliable
legislative history can still be useful, as it enables us to
corroborate and fortify our understanding of the text. See,
e.g., Tapia v. United States, 564 U. S. 319, 331–332 (2011);
Carr v. United States, 560 U. S. 438, 457–458 (2010).
Moreover, confirming our construction of a statute by
considering reliable legislative history shows respect for
and promotes comity with a coequal branch of Govern-
ment. See Katzmann, Judging Statutes, at 35–36.
   For these reasons, I do not think it wise for judges to
close their eyes to reliable legislative history—and the
realities of how Members of Congress create and enact
laws—when it is available.

            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

                        [February 21, 2018]


   JUSTICE THOMAS, with whom JUSTICE ALITO and
JUSTICE GORSUCH join, concurring in part and concurring
in the judgment.
   I join the Court’s opinion only to the extent it relies on
the text of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Con-
sumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank), 124 Stat. 1376. The
question in this case is whether the term “whistleblower”
in Dodd-Frank’s antiretaliation provision, 15 U. S. C.
§78u–6(h)(1), includes a person who does not report infor-
mation to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The
answer is in the definitions section of the statute, which
states that the term “whistleblower” means a person who
provides “information relating to a violation of the securi-
ties laws to the Commission.” §78u–6(a)(6). As the Court
observes, this statutory definition “resolves the question
before us.” Ante, at 9. The Court goes on, however, to
discuss the supposed “purpose” of the statute, which it
primarily derives from a single Senate Report. See ante,
at 3–4, 11–12, 16–18. Even assuming a majority of Con-
gress read the Senate Report, agreed with it, and voted for
Dodd-Frank with the same intent, “we are a government
of laws, not of men, and are governed by what Congress
enacted rather than by what it intended.”* Lawson v.

 * For what it is worth, I seriously doubt that a committee report is a

“particularly reliable source” for discerning “Congress’ intended mean-
ing.” Ante, at 1 (SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring). The following exchange
on the Senate floor is telling:
    “Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. President, will the Senator tell me whether
or not he wrote the committee report?
    “Mr. DOLE. Did I write the committee report?
    “Mr. ARMSTRONG. Yes.
    “Mr. DOLE. No; the Senator from Kansas did not write the com-
mittee report.
    “Mr. ARMSTRONG. Did any Senator write the committee report?
    “Mr. DOLE. I have to check.
    “Mr. ARMSTRONG. Does the Senator know of any Senator who
wrote the committee report?
    “Mr. DOLE. I might be able to identify one, but I would have to
search. I was here all during the time it was written, I might say, and
worked carefully with the staff as they worked. . . .
    “Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. President, has the Senator from Kansas,
the chairman of the Finance Committee, read the committee report in
its entirety?
    “Mr. DOLE. I am working on it. It is not a bestseller, but I am work-
ing on it.
    “Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. President, did members of the Finance
Committee vote on the committee report?
    “Mr. DOLE. No.
    “Mr. ARMSTRONG. . . . The report itself is not considered by the
Committee on Finance. It was not subject to amendment by the Com-
mittee on Finance. It is not subject to amendment now by the Senate.
. . . If there were matter within this report which was disagreed to by
the Senator from Colorado or even by a majority of all Senators, there
would be no way for us to change the report. I could not offer an
amendment tonight to amend the committee report. . . . [ L]et me just
make the point that this is not the law, it was not voted on, it is not
subject to amendment, and we should discipline ourselves to the task of
expressing congressional intent in the statute.” Hirschey v. FERC, 777

 No. 16–1067. Argued December 6, 2017—Decided February 21, 2018
Petitioner Charles Murphy was awarded a judgment in his federal civil
  rights suit against two of his prison guards, including an award of at-
  torney’s fees. Pursuant to </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">42</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §1997e(d)(2), which provides
  that in such cases “a portion of the [prisoner’s] judgment (not to ex-
  ceed 25 percent) shall be applied to satisfy the amount of attorney’s
  fees awarded against the defendant,” the district court ordered Mr.
  Murphy to pay 10% of his judgment toward the fee award, leaving de-
  fendants responsible for the remainder. The Seventh Circuit re-
  versed, holding that §1997e(d)(2) required the district court to ex-
  haust 25% of the prisoner’s judgment before demanding payment
  from the defendants.
Held: In cases governed by §1997e(d), district courts must apply as
 much of the judgment as necessary, up to 25%, to satisfy an award of
 attorney’s fees. The specific statutory language supports the Seventh
 Circuit’s interpretation. First, the mandatory phrase “shall be ap-
 plied” suggests that the district court has some nondiscretionary duty
 to perform. Second, the infinitival phrase “to satisfy the amount of
 attorney’s fees awarded” specifies the purpose or aim of the preceding
 verb’s nondiscretionary duty. Third, “to satisfy” an obligation, espe-
 cially a financial obligation, usually means to discharge the obliga-
 tion in full. Together, these three clues suggest that a district court
 (1) must act (2) with the purpose of (3) fully discharging the fee
 award. And the district court must use as much of the judgment as
 necessary to satisfy the fee award without exceeding the 25% cap.
 Contrary to Mr. Murphy’s suggestion, the district court does not have
 wide discretion to pick any “portion” that does not exceed the 25%
 cap. The larger statutory scheme supports the Seventh Circuit’s in-
 terpretation.    The previously governing provision, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">42</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">.

                                  Syllabus

    §1988(b), granted district courts discretion to award fees in unam-
    biguous terms. It is doubtful that Congress, had it wished to confer
    the same sort of discretion in §1997e(d), would have bothered to write
    a new law for prisoner civil rights suits alone; omit all of the words
    that afforded discretion in the old law; and then replace those old dis-
    cretionary words with new mandatory ones. This conclusion is rein-
    forced by §1997e(d)’s surrounding provisions, which like paragraph
    (2), also limit the district court’s pre-existing discretion under
    §1988(b). See, e.g., §§1997e(d)(1)(A) and (B)(ii). The discretion urged
    by Mr. Murphy is exactly the sort of unguided and freewheeling
    choice that this Court has sought to expunge from practice under
    §1988. And his suggested cure for rudderless discretion—to have dis-
    trict courts apportion fees in proportion to the defendant’s culpabil-
    ity—has no basis in the statutory text or roots in the law. Pp. 2–9.

 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

           APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT

                             [February 21, 2018]


  JUSTICE GORSUCH delivered the opinion of the Court.
  This is a case about how much prevailing prisoners
must pay their lawyers. When a prisoner wins a civil
rights suit and the district court awards fees to the pris-
oner’s attorney, a federal statute says that “a portion of
the [prisoner’s] judgment (not to exceed 25 percent) shall
be applied to satisfy the amount of attorney’s fees awarded
against the defendant. If the award of attorney’s fees is
not greater than 150 percent of the judgment, the excess
shall be paid by the defendant.” </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">42</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §1997e(d)(2).
Whatever else you might make of this, the first sentence
pretty clearly tells us that the prisoner has to pay some
part of the attorney’s fee award before financial responsi-
bility shifts to the defendant. But how much is enough?
Does the first sentence allow the district court discretion
to take any amount it wishes from the plaintiff ’s judgment
to pay the attorney, from 25% down to a penny? Or does
the first sentence instead mean that the court must pay
the attorney’s entire fee award from the plaintiff ’s judg-
ment until it reaches the 25% cap and only then turn to
the defendant?
2                    MURPHY v. SMITH

                     Opinion of the Court

   The facts of our case illustrate the problem we face.
After a jury trial, the district court entered judgment for
Charles Murphy in the amount of $307,733.82 against two
of his prison guards, Officer Robert Smith and Lieutenant
Gregory Fulk. The court also awarded Mr. Murphy’s
attorney $108,446.54 in fees. So far, so good. But then
came the question who should pay what portion of the fee
award. The defendants argued that, under the statute’s
terms, the court had to take 25% (or about $77,000) from
Mr. Murphy’s judgment before taxing them for the balance
of the fee award. The court, however, refused that re-
quest. Instead, it ordered that Mr. Murphy “shall pay 10%
of [his] judgment” (or about $31,000) toward the fee
award, with the defendants responsible for the rest. In
support of this allocation, the district court explained that
it commonly varied the amount prisoners pay, though the
court offered no explanation for choosing 10% instead of
some other number. On appeal, a unanimous panel re-
versed, explaining its view that the language of
§1997e(d)(2) requires a district court to exhaust 25% of the
prisoner’s judgment before demanding payment from the
defendants. </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">844</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.3d</span> <span class=""page"">653</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 660 (CA7 2016). So there we
have both sides of the debate, and our question, in a nut-
shell: did the district court have latitude to apply 10% (or
some other discretionary amount) of the plaintiff ’s judg-
ment to his attorney’s fee award instead of 25%? See
582 U. S. ___ (2017) (granting certiorari to resolve this
question).
   As always, we start with the specific statutory language
in dispute. That language (again) says “a portion of the
judgment (not to exceed 25 percent) shall be applied to
satisfy the amount of attorney’s fees awarded.”
§1997e(d)(2). And we think this much tells us a few
things. First, the word “shall” usually creates a mandate,
not a liberty, so the verb phrase “shall be applied” tells us
that the district court has some nondiscretionary duty to
                      Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)                      3

perform. See Lexecon Inc. v. Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes
& Lerach, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""118177""><a href=""/opinion/118177/lexecon-inc-v-milberg-weiss-bershad-hynes-lerach/""><span class=""volume"">523</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">26</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 35 (1998) (“[T]he mandatory ‘shall’
. . . normally creates an obligation impervious to judicial
discretion”). Second, immediately following the verb we
find an infinitival phrase (“to satisfy the amount of attor-
ney’s fees awarded”) that specifies the purpose or aim of
the verb’s non-discretionary duty. Cf. R. Huddleston &
G. Pullum, Cambridge Grammar of the English Language,
ch. 8, §§1, 12.2, pp. 669, 729–730 (2002). Third, we know
that when you purposefully seek or aim “to satisfy” an
obligation, especially a financial obligation, that usually
means you intend to discharge the obligation in full.1
Together, then, these three clues suggest that the court (1)
must apply judgment funds toward the fee award (2) with
the purpose of (3) fully discharging the fee award. And to
meet that duty, a district court must apply as much of the
judgment as necessary to satisfy the fee award, without of
course exceeding the 25% cap. If Congress had wished to
afford the judge more discretion in this area, it could have
easily substituted “may” for “shall.” And if Congress had
wished to prescribe a different purpose for the judge to
pursue, it could have easily replaced the infinitival phrase
“to satisfy . . . ” with “to reduce . . . ” or “against . . . .” But
Congress didn’t choose those other words. And respect for
Congress’s prerogatives as policymaker means carefully
attending to the words it chose rather than replacing them

4                    MURPHY v. SMITH

                     Opinion of the Court

with others of our own.
   Mr. Murphy’s reply does more to hurt than help his
cause. Consider, he says, college math credits that the
college prospectus says shall be “applied to satisfy” a
chemistry degree. No one, the argument goes, would
understand that phrase to suggest a single math course
will fully discharge all chemistry degree requirements.
We quite agree, but that is beside the point. In Mr. Mur-
phy’s example, as in our statute, the word “satisfy” does
not suggest some hidden empirical judgment about how
often a math class will satisfy a chemistry degree. Instead
it serves to tell the college registrar what purpose he must
pursue when handed the student’s transcript: the regis-
trar must, without discretion, apply those credits toward
the satisfaction or discharge of the student’s credit obliga-
tions. No doubt a college student needing three credits to
graduate who took a three-credit math course would be
bewildered to learn the registrar thought he had discre-
tion to count only two of those credits toward her degree.
So too here. It doesn’t matter how many fee awards will
be fully satisfied from a judgment without breaking the
25% cap, or whether any particular fee award could be.
The statute’s point is to instruct the judge about the pur-
pose he must pursue—to discharge the fee award using
judgment funds to the extent possible, subject to the 25%
cap.
   Retreating now, Mr. Murphy contends that whatever
the verb and the infinitival phrase mean, the subject of
the sentence—“a portion of the judgment (not to exceed 25
percent)”—necessarily suggests wide judicial discretion.
This language, he observes, anticipates a range of
amounts (some “portion” up to 25%) that can be taken
from his judgment. And the existence of the range, Mr.
Murphy contends, necessarily means that the district
court must enjoy discretion to pick any “portion” so long as
it doesn’t exceed the 25% cap.

                     Opinion of the Court

   But that does not logically follow. Under either side’s
reading of the statute the portion of fees taken from the
plaintiff ’s judgment will vary over a range—whether
because of the district court’s discretionary choice (as Mr.
Murphy contends), or because of the variance in the size of
fee awards themselves, which sometimes will be less than
25% of the judgment (as Officer Smith and Lieutenant
Fulk suggest). If the police have two suspects in a robbery
committed with a red getaway car, the fact that one sus-
pect drives a red sedan proves nothing if the other does
too. The fact that the statute contemplates a range of
possible “portion[s]” to be paid out of the judgment, thus,
just doesn’t help identify which of the two proposed inter-
pretations we should adopt for both bear that feature.
   Nor does the word “portion” necessarily denote unfet-
tered discretion. If someone told you to follow a written
recipe but double the portion of sugar, you would know
precisely how much sugar to put in—twice whatever’s on
the page. And Congress has certainly used the word
“portion” in just that way. Take </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">16</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §673b, which
defines the National Elk Refuge to include the “[e]ntire
portion now in Jackson Hole National Monument except
that portion in section 2 lying west of the east right-of-way
line of United States Highway Numbered 187,” among
other similar plots—descriptions sufficiently determinate
that the statute itself can later give the total number of
acres of covered land (“six thousand three hundred and
seventy-six acres, more or less”). So the question is how
has Congress used the word “portion” in this statute? And
as we have explained, the text persuades us that, subject
to the 25% cap, the size of the relevant “portion” here is
fixed by reference to the size of the attorney’s fee award,
not left to a district court’s unguided choice.
   Even if the interpretive race in this case seems close at
this point, close races still have winners. Besides, step-
ping back to take in the larger statutory scheme surround-
6                     MURPHY v. SMITH

                      Opinion of the Court

ing the specific language before us reveals that this case
isn’t quite as close as it might first appear. In 1976, Con-
gress enacted what is now </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">42</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §1988(b) to author-
ize discretionary fee shifting in civil rights suits. Civil
Rights Attorney’s Fees Awards Act, 90 Stat. 2641. For
years that statute governed the award of attorney’s fees in
a large variety of civil rights actions, including prisoner
civil rights lawsuits like this one. But in the Prison Liti-
gation Reform Act of 1995, Congress reentered the field
and adopted §1997e’s new and specialized fee shifting
rule for prisoner civil rights suits alone. See 110 Stat.
1321–71.
    Comparing the terms of the old and new statutes helps
to shed a good deal of light on the parties’ positions. Sec-
tion 1988(b) confers discretion on district courts in unam-
biguous terms: “[T]he court, in its discretion, may allow
the prevailing party . . . a reasonable attorney’s fee as part
of the costs” against the defendant. (Emphasis added.)
Meanwhile, §1997e(d) expressly qualifies the usual opera-
tion of §1988(b) in prisoner cases. See §1997e(d)(1)
(providing that “[i]n any action brought by a prisoner . . .
in which attorney’s fees are authorized under section 1988
. . . such fees shall not be awarded, except” under certain
conditions). And as we’ve seen §1997e(d)(2) proceeds to
use very different language to describe the district court’s
job in awarding fees. It does not say “may,” it does not say
“reasonable,” and it certainly does not say anything about
“discretion.” If Congress had wished to confer the same
discretion in §1997e(d) that it conferred in §1988(b), we
very much doubt it would have bothered to write a new
law; omit all the words that afforded discretion in the old
law; and then replace those old discretionary words with
new mandatory ones. See Russello v. United States, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""111043""><a href=""/opinion/111043/russello-v-united-states/""><span class=""volume"">464</span>

language” in two statutory provisions “has the same
meaning in each”).

                      Opinion of the Court

   The surrounding statutory structure of §1997e(d) rein-
forces this conclusion. Like paragraph (2), the other pro-
visions of §1997e(d) also limit the district court’s pre-
existing discretion under §1988(b). These provisions limit
the fees that would otherwise be available under §1988 to
cover only certain kinds of lawyerly tasks, see
§§1997e(d)(1)(A) and (B)(ii); they require proportionality
between fee awards and the relief ordered, see
§1997e(d)(1)(B)(i); and they restrict the hourly rate of the
prisoner’s lawyer, see §1997e(d)(3). All this suggests a
statute that seeks to restrain, rather than replicate, the
discretion found in §1988(b).
   Notably, too, the discretion Mr. Murphy would have us
introduce into §1997e doesn’t even sit easily with our
precedent under §1988. Our cases interpreting §1988
establish “[a] strong presumption that the lodestar fig-
ure—the product of reasonable hours times a reasonable
rate—represents a ‘reasonable’ fee.” Pennsylvania v.
Delaware Valley Citizens’ Council for Clean Air, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""111749""><a href=""/opinion/111749/pennsylvania-v-delaware-valley-citizens-council-for-clean-air/""><span class=""volume"">478</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span>
<span class=""page"">546</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 565 (1986). To be sure, before the lodestar became
“the guiding light of our fee shifting jurisprudence,” Bur-
lington v. Dague, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""112778""><a href=""/opinion/112778/burlington-v-dague/""><span class=""volume"">505</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">557</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 562 (1992), many lower
courts used one of your classic 12-factor balancing tests.
See Delaware Valley, 478 U. S., at 562, and n. 7. Ulti-
mately, though, this Court rejected undue reliance on the
12-factor test because it “gave very little actual guidance
to district courts[,] . . . placed unlimited discretion in trial
judges[,] and produced disparate results.” Id., at 563. Yet,
despite this guidance, Mr. Murphy effectively seeks to
(re)introduce into §1997e(d)(2) exactly the sort of unguided
and freewheeling choice—and the disparate results that
come with it—that this Court has sought to expunge from
practice under §1988. And he seeks to achieve all this on
the basis of considerably less helpful statutory language.
To state the suggestion is to reveal its defect.
   Nor does Mr. Murphy’s proposed cure solve his problem.
8                         MURPHY v. SMITH

                          Opinion of the Court

To avoid reading §1997e(d)(2) as affording entirely rudder-
less discretion, Mr. Murphy contends that district courts
should apportion fees in proportion to the defendant’s
culpability. When a defendant has acted egregiously, he
says, the court should lower the plaintiff ’s responsibility
for the fee award and increase the defendant’s—even if
that means applying only a “nominal” amount of the
plaintiff ’s judgment toward the fee. But precisely none of
this appears in §1997e(d)(2) or, for that matter, enjoys any
analogue in §1988’s lodestar analysis or even the old 12-
factor approach. Whatever you might have to say about
Mr. Murphy’s culpability formula as a matter of policy, it
has no roots in the law. Nor is it clear, for what it’s worth,
that the culpability approach would even help him. The
district court never cited the defendants’ culpability (or
any other reason) to justify taking only 10% rather than
25% from Mr. Murphy’s judgment. And it’s tough to see
what the choice of 10% might have had to do with the
defendant’s culpability in this case. The district court
actually remitted the jury’s punitive damages award—
suggesting that, if anything, the defendants’ culpability
had been already amply addressed.
  At the end of the day, what may have begun as a close
race turns out to have a clear winner. Now with a view of
the full field of textual, contextual, and precedential evi-
dence, we think the interpretation the court of appeals
adopted prevails. In cases governed by §1997e(d), we hold
that district courts must apply as much of the judgment as
necessary, up to 25%, to satisfy an award of attorney’s
fees.2
——————
  2 Even for those of us who might be inclined to entertain it, Mr. Mur-

phy’s legislative history argument fails to overcome the textual, contex-
tual, and precedential evidence before us. He points to an early draft of
§1997e(d)(2) that read: “Whenever a monetary judgment is awarded in
an action described in paragraph (1), a portion of the judgment (not to
exceed 25 percent) shall be applied to satisfy the amount of attorney’s

defendant.” Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995, S. 1279, 104th Cong.,
1st Sess., §3(d), p. 16 (1995) (emphasis added). Mr. Murphy admits
that the italicized language in the second sentence suggests that it is
the size of the attorney’s fees award, not some invisible discretion, that
determines what the defendant must pay. Yet, he notes, the second
sentence was revised in the legislative process and now reads: “If the
award of attorney’s fees is not greater than 150 percent of the judgment,

   But what exactly does this amendment process prove, even taken on
its own terms? It shows that, at some stage of the bill’s consideration,
its proponents likely shared our understanding that the (still un-
changed) first sentence doesn’t give district courts the discretion to
allocate fees to the defendant as they please. For if such discretion
were intended, it would have been incoherent for the drafters to say, in
the second sentence, that defendants must pay only “[i]f the award of
attorney’s fees is greater than 25 percent of the judgment,” instead of
whenever the district court chooses. Beyond that, the amendment
process tells us nothing. Did legislators voting on the measure agree
with our interpretation of the first sentence and drop the confirmatory
language from the second as flabby duplication? Or did they drop it
because, as Mr. Murphy supposes, they thought it erroneous or even
just bad policy? Did anyone voting on the measure even think about
this question? There is no way to know, and we will not try to guess.

           APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT

                     [February 21, 2018]


  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG,
JUSTICE BREYER, and JUSTICE KAGAN join, dissenting.
  The Court concludes that the attorney’s fee apportion-
ment provision of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995
(PLRA), </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">42</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §1997e(d)(2), requires that a district
court endeavor to fulfill the entirety of an attorney’s fee
award from the monetary judgment awarded to a prevail-
ing prisoner-plaintiff, and only if 25 percent of the judg-
ment is inadequate to cover the fee award can the court
require contribution from the defendant. Ante, at 8. I
cannot agree. The text of §1997e(d)(2)—“a portion of the
judgment (not to exceed 25 percent) shall be applied to
satisfy the amount of attorney’s fees awarded against the
defendant”—and its statutory context make clear that the
provision permits district courts to exercise discretion in
choosing the portion of a prisoner-plaintiff ’s monetary
judgment that must be applied toward an attorney’s fee
award, so long as that portion is not greater than 25 per-
cent. I therefore respectfully dissent.
                             I
  In approaching this case, it helps to understand the
background of the fee award at issue. On July 25, 2011,
petitioner Charles Murphy, a prisoner at the Vandalia
Correctional Center in Illinois, reported that his assigned
2                    MURPHY v. SMITH

                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

seat at mealtime had food and water on it, which resulted
in Murphy being handcuffed and escorted to a segregation
building. Once there, Murphy taunted respondent Correc-
tional Officer Robert Smith, who responded by hitting
Murphy in the eye and applying a choke hold, causing
Murphy to lose consciousness. When Murphy woke up,
Officer Smith and respondent Lieutenant Gregory Fulk
were pushing him into a cell. His hands were still cuffed
behind his back and he fell face-first into the cell and hit
his head on a metal toilet. Officer Smith and Lieutenant
Fulk then stripped Murphy of his clothes, removed his
handcuffs, and left him in the cell without checking his
condition. Thirty or forty minutes passed until a nurse
arrived to attend to Murphy, who was sent to a hospital.
Part of his eye socket had been crushed and required
surgery. Despite the procedure, Murphy did not fully
recover; almost five years later, his vision remained dou-
bled and blurred.
   Murphy sued respondents under </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">42</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §1983 and
state-law causes of action. After trial, a jury found Officer
Smith liable for state-law battery and unconstitutional use
of force under the Eighth Amendment, and found Lieuten-
ant Fulk liable for deliberate indifference to a serious
medical need in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The
jury awarded Murphy $409,750.00 in compensatory and
punitive damages, which the District Court reduced to
$307,733.82. The District Court also awarded Murphy’s
attorney $108,446.54 in fees for the several hundred hours
he spent on the case and, pursuant to §1997e(d)(2), or-
dered Murphy to contribute 10 percent of his money judg-
ment toward the attorney’s fee award and respondents to
pay the rest.
   Respondents appealed, arguing that §1997e(d)(2) re-
quired Murphy to contribute 25 percent of his judgment
toward payment of the attorney’s fee award. The Court of
Appeals for the Seventh Circuit agreed and reversed. In

so doing, it acknowledged that its interpretation of
§1997e(d)(2) was at odds with that of all the other Courts

                             A

  The relevant provision in the PLRA provides:
    “Whenever a monetary judgment is awarded in [a
    civil-rights action brought by a prisoner], a portion of
    the judgment (not to exceed 25 percent) shall be ap-
    plied to satisfy the amount of attorney’s fees awarded
    against the defendant. If the award of attorney’s fees
    is not greater than 150 percent of the judgment, the
    excess shall be paid by the defendant.” </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">42</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">.
    §1997e(d)(2).
   The crux of the majority’s reasoning is its definition of
the infinitive “to satisfy.” The majority contends that
“when you purposefully seek or aim ‘to satisfy’ an obliga-
tion, especially a financial obligation, that usually means
you intend to discharge the obligation in full.” Ante, at 3.
To meet its duty to act with the purpose of fully discharg-
ing the fee award, the majority reasons, “a district court
must apply as much of the judgment as necessary to sat-
isfy the fee award, without of course exceeding the 25%
cap.” Ibid.
   But the phrase “to satisfy” as it is used in §1997e(d)(2)
does not bear the weight the majority places on it. Its
neighboring text and the realities of prisoner-civil-rights
litigation rebut the conclusion that “to satisfy” compels
a district court always to maximize the amount of the
prisoner-plaintiff ’s judgment to be contributed to the fee
award, and instead indicate that the only work “to satisfy”
4                     MURPHY v. SMITH

                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

does in the statute is to direct a district court to contribute
some amount of the judgment toward payment of the fee
award.
   Beginning with the neighboring text, it may well be
that, standing alone, “to satisfy” is often used to mean “to
completely fulfill an obligation.” But the statutory provi-
sion here does not simply say “to satisfy”; it says “applied
to satisfy.” As a matter of everyday usage, the phrase
“applied to satisfy” often means “applied toward the satis-
faction of,” rather than “applied in complete fulfillment
of.” Thus, whereas an action undertaken “to satisfy” an
obligation might, as the majority suggests, naturally be
understood as an effort to discharge the obligation in full,
ante, at 3, a contribution that is “applied to satisfy” an
obligation need not be intended to discharge the obligation
in full.
   Take a few examples: A consumer makes a payment on
her credit card, which her agreement with the card com-
pany provides shall be “applied to satisfy” her debt. A
student enrolls in a particular type of math class, the
credits from which her university registrar earlier an-
nounced shall be “applied to satisfy” the requirements of a
physics degree. And a law firm associate contributes
hours to a pro bono matter that her firm has provided may
be “applied to satisfy” the firm’s overall billable-hours
requirement. In each case, pursuant to the relevant
agreement, the payment, credits, and hours are applied
toward the satisfaction of a larger obligation, but the
inference is not that the consumer, student, or associate
had to contribute or even necessarily did contribute the
maximum possible credit card payment, classroom credits,
or hours toward the fulfillment of those obligations. The
consumer may have chosen to make the minimum credit
card payment because she preferred to allocate her other
funds elsewhere; the student may have chosen the four-
credit version of the math course over the six-credit one
                  Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)              5

                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

because the former had a better instructor; and the asso-
ciate may have been judicious about the hours she dedi-
cated to the pro bono matter because she knew her firm
more highly valued paid over pro bono work. So, too, here.
Section 1997e(d)(2), like the credit card agreement, uni-
versity registrar announcement, and law firm policy, sets
out the relevant rule—“a portion of the judgment (not to
exceed 25 percent) shall be applied to satisfy” the fee
award—and the district court, like the consumer, student,
and law firm associate, decides how much of the judgment
to apply.
   As a practical matter, moreover, a district court will
almost never be able to discharge fully a fee award from
25 percent of a prisoner-plaintiff ’s judgment. In the vast
majority of prisoner-civil-rights cases, the attorney’s fee
award exceeds the monetary judgment awarded to the
prevailing prisoner-plaintiff. In fiscal year 2012, for in-
stance, the median damages award in a prisoner-civil-
rights action litigated to victory (i.e., not settled or decided
against the prisoner) was a mere $4,185. See Schlanger,
Trends in Prisoner Litigation, as the PLRA Enters Adult-
hood, 5 U. C. Irvine L. Rev. 153, 168 (2015) (Table 7)
(Trends in Prisoner Litigation). Therefore, in 2012, the
maximum amount (25 percent) of the median judgment
that could be applied toward an attorney’s fee award was
$1,046.25. The PLRA caps the hourly rate that may be
awarded to a prisoner-plaintiff ’s attorney at 150 percent
of the rate for court-appointed counsel under </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">18</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">.

App. to Pet. for Cert. 21a. Thus, a prisoner’s attorney was
entitled to up to $187.50 per hour worked. Even if a dis-
trict court were to apply an hourly rate of just $100, well
below the cap, unless the attorney put in fewer than 10.5
hours in the ordinary case—a virtually unimaginable
scenario—25 percent of the judgment will not come close
6                         MURPHY v. SMITH

                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

to discharging fully the attorney’s fee award.1
   Such low judgments are not a new phenomenon in
prisoner-civil-rights suits; they were the norm even before
Congress enacted the PLRA. In fiscal year 1993, for ex-
ample, the median damages award for prisoner-plaintiffs
in cases won at trial was $1,000. See Trends in Prisoner
Litigation 167; Schlanger, Inmate Litigation, 116 Harv. L.
Rev. 1555, 1602–1603, and Table II.C (2003).2
   Given the very small judgment awards in successfully
litigated prisoner-civil-rights cases, it is hard to believe, as
the majority contends, that Congress used “applied to
satisfy” to command an effort by district courts to “dis-
charge . . . in full,” ante, at 3, when in most cases, full
discharge will never be possible.3 Rather, taking into
account both the realities of prisoner-civil-rights litigation
and the most natural reading of “applied to satisfy,” the
more logical inference is that §1997e(d)(2) simply requires
that a portion of the prevailing prisoner-plaintiff ’s judg-
ment be applied toward the satisfaction of the attorney’s
fee award.4 It does not, however, demand that the district
court always order the prisoner-plaintiff to pay the maxi-
mum possible portion of the judgment (up to 25 percent)
——————
   1 A similar conclusion obtains if one considers the average, rather

than the median, damages award in a prisoner-civil-rights action
litigated to victory, which in 2012 was $20,815. See Trends in Prisoner
Litigation 168 (Table 7).
   2 The average such award in 1993, excluding one extreme outlier of

$6.5 million, was $18,800. See Trends in Prisoner Litigation 167;
Schlanger, 116 Harv. L. Rev., at 1603.
   3 In fact, even here, where the monetary judgment awarded to Mur-

phy was well above the average award in prisoner-civil-rights cases, 25
percent of the judgment cannot fully discharge the fees awarded to his
attorney.
   4 Irrespective of what portion of the judgment the district court ulti-

mately requires the prisoner-plaintiff to contribute to the fee award, the
award will always be satisfied, i.e., paid in full, for once the prisoner-
plaintiff provides his contribution from the judgment, the defendant
will be called upon to contribute the remainder.

needed to discharge fully the fee award. Under that inter-
pretation, applying any amount of Murphy’s judgment
toward payment of his attorney’s fee award complies with
§1997e(d)(2), whether that amount is 10 percent of the
judgment as ordered by the District Court or 25 percent as
ordered by the Court of Appeals.
                              B
  The majority suggests that if Congress had wanted to
permit judges to pursue something other than full dis-
charge of the fee award from the judgment, it could have
replaced “to satisfy” with “to reduce” or “against.” Ante, at
3. But the majority ignores that Congress also easily
could have written §1997e(d)(2) to more clearly express
the meaning it and respondents champion. The statute,
for example, simply could have said: “Twenty-five percent
of the plaintiff ’s judgment shall be applied to satisfy the
amount of attorney’s fees awarded against the defendant.
If the award of attorney’s fees is not greater than 150
percent of the judgment, the excess shall be paid by the
defendant.”
  In fact, Congress considered and rejected language prior
to enacting the current attorney’s fee apportionment
provision that would have done just what the majority
claims. An earlier version of §1997e(d)(2) provided:
    “Whenever a monetary judgment is awarded in an ac-
    tion described in paragraph (1), a portion of the judg-
    ment (not to exceed 25 percent) shall be applied to sat-
    isfy the amount of attorney’s fees awarded against the
    defendant. If the award of attorney’s fees is greater
    than 25 percent of the judgment, the excess shall be
    paid by the defendant.” Prison Litigation Reform Act
    of 1995, S. 1279, 104th Cong., 1st Sess., §3(d), p. 16
    (1995) (emphasis added).
  The italicized clause plainly expressed what the major-
8                    MURPHY v. SMITH

                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

ity contends the current provision means, i.e., that a de-
fendant’s liability for the attorney’s fee award begins only
if any portion of the award remains unpaid after the pre-
vailing prisoner-plaintiff has contributed 25 percent of the
judgment. But Congress removed this clause before final-
izing the bill, thus electing to keep the 25-percent ceiling
for the prisoner-plaintiff ’s contribution to the fee award
and rejecting a 25-percent floor for the defendant’s contri-
bution. See H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 104–378, p. 71 (1995).
   The majority alternatively disclaims the ability to dis-
cern what motivated the deletion and pronounces that “[i]t
shows that, at some stage of the bill’s consideration, its
proponents likely shared [the majority’s] understanding”
of how the first sentence works. Ante, at 8–9, n. 2. In the
majority’s view, it is more likely that Congress drafted two
redundant sentences than two conflicting ones. Ibid.
That supposition, however, is purely speculative. Here is
what is known for certain: Congress had before it lan-
guage that would have accomplished exactly the statutory
function the majority today endorses and Congress chose
to excise that language from the text. Our precedent
instructs that “[w]here Congress includes limiting lan-
guage in an earlier version of a bill but deletes it prior to
enactment, it may be presumed that the limitation was
not intended.” Russello v. United States, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""111043""><a href=""/opinion/111043/russello-v-united-states/""><span class=""volume"">464</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">16</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 23–

language that it has earlier discarded in favor of other
language’ ”).
                            C
  The rest of the statutory text confirms that district
courts have discretion to choose the amount of the judg-
ment that must be applied toward the attorney’s fee

award. Specifically, that grant of discretion is evident
from Congress’ use of two discretion-conferring terms,
“portion” and “not to exceed.”
   The first word, “portion,” is defined as “[a] share or
allotted part (as of an estate).” Black’s Law Dictionary
1182 (7th ed. 1999). “Portion” thus inherently conveys an
indeterminate amount. Take, for instance, the following
sentence: “My dinner guest has requested a portion of
apple pie for dessert.” How much is a “portion” of pie? For
a marathon runner, a “portion” might mean a hearty
serving, perhaps an eighth of a whole pie; for someone on
a diet, however, a “portion” might mean a tiny sliver. The
dinner host can figure it out based on the circumstances.
Similarly, in this context, referencing a “portion” of the
judgment tells us that some amount of the judgment up to
25 percent of the whole is to be applied to the attorney’s
fee award, but not exactly what amount. That decision is
left to the sound discretion of the district court, depending
again on the circumstances.
   The majority dismisses as insignificant Congress’ use of
this discretion-conferring term, arguing that under either
side’s reading of the statute, the “portion” of fees taken
from the prisoner-plaintiff ’s judgment will vary. See ante,
at 5. True enough,5 but that fact does not justify the
majority’s brushoff. Congress’ deliberate choice to use the
indeterminate, discretion-conferring term “portion” in
§1997e(d)(2) reveals much about the statute’s meaning.
   To illustrate the significance of Congress’ use of the
word “portion,” imagine that §1997e(d)(2) contained no
qualifying “not to exceed” parenthetical, and instead pro-
——————
   5 Notably, such variation will be far less common under the majority’s

reading. Given that the fee awards in prisoner-civil-rights victories
almost always exceed the monetary judgments, see Part II–A, supra, on
the majority’s reading, it will be the rare case indeed when the “por-
tion” of the judgment applied to the fee award will be anything other
than 25 percent.
10                        MURPHY v. SMITH

                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

vided only that “a portion of the judgment shall be applied
to satisfy the amount of attorney’s fees awarded against
the defendant.” As applied to the typical scenario, i.e.,
where the attorney’s fee award exceeds the prisoner-
plaintiff ’s money judgment, the most natural reading of
the statute absent the limiting parenthetical is that the
amount of the judgment applied to the fee award must be
more than zero and less than 100 percent. That is be-
cause, as explained above, “portion” means something less
than the whole but does not have a fixed value.6 If the
majority were correct in its reading of “to satisfy,” how-
ever—that it requires the district court to endeavor to dis-
charge fully the attorney’s fee award from the prisoner-
plaintiff ’s judgment before turning to the defendant for a
contribution—then, in the typical case, absent the paren-
thetical, we would have to conclude that “a portion of the
judgment” always means “all of the judgment” or perhaps
“all of the judgment save a nominal amount.” I do not
think it reasonable to conclude that Congress intended to
ascribe such a strained meaning to “portion.” That the
majority’s reading of one term—“to satisfy”—forces an
implausible reading of another term—“portion”—strongly
suggests that its reading is incorrect.
  Congress’ use of the word “portion,” therefore, does not
merely instruct that there are a range of possible portions
that can be paid out of the judgment. “Portion” makes
evident that the district court is afforded the discretion to
——————
  6 Of course, “portion” can gain a more determinate meaning by its

surrounding context, as the majority’s examples illustrate. See ante, at
5. But §1997e(d)(2) is not like the recipe that quantifies the initial
portion of sugar to be doubled or the statutory provision that describes
with geographic precision the lands to be made part of the National Elk
Refuge. “[T]o satisfy” simply instructs that some portion of the prisoner-
plaintiff ’s judgment “not to exceed 25 percent” be applied toward the
satisfaction of the fee award. See supra, at 6. Section 1997e(d)(2)
therefore lacks the clarifying details present in the majority’s examples
that would give fixed meaning to the word “portion.”

choose the amount of the judgment to be paid toward the
fee award. The addition of the “not to exceed 25 percent”
parenthetical only enhances this conclusion. The phrase
“not to exceed,” which is itself discretion conferring, sets
an upper, but not a lower, limit and thus cabins, but does
not eliminate, the exercise of discretion that “portion”
confers.
                               D
  The distinction between cabining and eliminating dis-
cretion is also key to understanding the relationship be-
tween §1997e(d) and </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">42</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §1988(b), as well as be-
tween §1997e(d)(2) and its surrounding statutory
provisions.
  Section 1988(b), the Civil Rights Attorney’s Fees Awards
Act of 1976, authorizes a district court to award “a reason-
able attorney’s fee” to a prevailing party in an action to
enforce one or more of several federal civil rights laws.
Section 1997e(d) in turn imposes limits on the attorney’s
fees available under §1988(b) when the prevailing plaintiff
in one of the specified civil-rights actions is a prisoner. In
particular, the district court may award attorney’s fees to
the prisoner only if “the fee was directly and reasonably
incurred in proving an actual violation of the plaintiff ’s
rights protected by a statute pursuant to which a fee may
be awarded under section 1988,” and “the amount of the
fee is proportionately related to the court ordered relief for
the violation” or “the fee was directly and reasonably
incurred in enforcing the relief ordered for the violation.”
§1997e(d)(1). In addition, as noted supra, at 5, the district
court may not base an award of attorney’s fees “on an
hourly rate greater than 150 percent of the hourly rate
established under [</pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">18</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §3006A] for payment of
court-appointed counsel” and, if the prisoner-plaintiff was
awarded damages, may not award attorney’s fees in excess
of 150 percent of the monetary judgment. §§1997e(d)(2)–

(3).
   These provisions, of course, do not eliminate a district
court’s discretion when it comes to the award of attorney’s
fees to a prevailing prisoner-plaintiff; they merely com-
press the range of permissible options. A district court
still has the discretion to decide whether to award attor-
ney’s fees, just as it ordinarily would under §1988(b); it
simply must first ensure that the threshold conditions set
out in §1997e(d)(1) are satisfied. A district court likewise
still has the discretion to determine what constitutes a
reasonable amount of fees to award; it simply must abide
by the two 150-percent caps in doing so.
   Just as these surrounding statutory provisions in
§1997e(d) set outward bounds on a district court’s exercise
of discretion while still preserving the exercise of discre-
tion within those bounds, so, too, does §1997e(d)(2). A
district court is not free to require the defendant to pay
the entire attorney’s fee award, nor is it free to require the
prisoner-plaintiff to give up more than 25 percent of his
judgment to pay the fee award. But within those bounda-
ries, the district court is free to decide which party should
pay what portion of the fee award.
   The majority suggests that affording discretion to dis-
trict courts when it comes to the apportionment of attor-
ney’s fee awards is in tension with our adoption of the
lodestar method as the presumptive means of calculating
a reasonable fee award under §1988. Ante, at 7. Prior to
the lodestar’s development, several lower courts utilized
12 “sometimes subjective factors.” Pennsylvania v. Dela-
ware Valley Citizens’ Council for Clean Air, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""111749""><a href=""/opinion/111749/pennsylvania-v-delaware-valley-citizens-council-for-clean-air/""><span class=""volume"">478</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">546</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">,

cretion in trial judges and produced disparate results,”

to which a court multiplies “the number of hours reasona-
bly expended on the litigation times a reasonable hourly
rate,” Blum v. Stenson, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""111123""><a href=""/opinion/111123/blum-v-stenson/""><span class=""volume"">465</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">886</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 888 (1984), and then

considers whether to make adjustments to that amount,

435 (1983). The majority asserts that adopting Murphy’s
reading of §1997e(d)(2) would lead to “exactly the sort of
unguided and freewheeling choice” this Court sought to
leave behind when it sanctioned the lodestar approach.
Ante, at 7. That analogy, however, is inapt.
  First, the question before us is whether §1997e(d)(2)
affords district courts any discretion in the apportionment
of responsibility for payment of an attorney’s fee award,
not how district courts reasonably should exercise that
discretion. When this Court embraced the lodestar ap-
proach, it did so to provide guideposts to district courts as
they exercised the discretion granted to them by §1988(b)
to “allow the prevailing party . . . a reasonable attorney’s
fee.” By no means did this Court eliminate that exercise of
discretion. Rather, the Court has “reemphasize[d] that
the district court has discretion in determining the
amount of a fee award.” Hensley, 461 U. S., at 437; see
also Blum, 465 U. S., at 902, n. 19 (“A district court is
expressly empowered to exercise discretion in determining
whether an award is to be made and if so its reasonable-
ness”); id., at 896 (explaining that the proper standard of
review of an attorney’s fee award is abuse of discretion).
As was the case for the District Court here, that exercise
of discretion can include, for example, whether a defend-
ant is entitled to a reduction in hours where a plaintiff did
not succeed on all his claims, and whether certain claimed
expenses are reasonable. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 22a–
26a.
  If the majority is concerned that district courts are
exercising the apportionment discretion afforded to them
by §1997e(d)(2) in an uneven or unguided manner, the
solution is not to read the conferral of discretion out of the
statute entirely. Instead, as occurred in the §1988(b)
context, the Court could endorse a method for apportion-
14                        MURPHY v. SMITH

                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

ing attorney’s fee awards that can consistently be applied
across cases.7 Just as courts ultimately were capable,
through trial-and-error, of discerning an appropriate
formula for assessing the reasonableness of a given fee
award, see Delaware Valley, 478 U. S., at 562–565, so, too,
are they capable of determining a sound approach to the
apportionment decision envisioned by §1997e(d)(2).8
  Second, even absent an equivalent method to the lode-
star inquiry, §1997e(d)(2) does not, unlike the old 12-factor
analysis for calculating fee awards, afford unlimited dis-
cretion. Congress provided express bounds on a district
court’s apportionment discretion, requiring that it order
the prevailing prisoner-plaintiff to contribute at least
some part of his money judgment to the fee award but no
more than 25 percent.
  Finally, it is not obvious that the need for a more regi-
mented approach with respect to calculating the amount of
an attorney’s fee award under §1988(b) should dictate the
need for a similarly regimented approach with respect to
the apportionment of responsibility for that award under
§1997e(d)(2). The two decisions involve fundamentally
different inquiries: The first is focused on the prevailing-
plaintiff ’s attorney and is concerned with determining a
reasonable value for services rendered in pursuing the
action, and the second is focused on the parties and is
concerned with assessing the extent to which each party
——————
  7 Such  an apportionment method could, for example, account for a
defendant’s conduct during the litigation, just as the lodestar method
considers the prevailing-plaintiff ’s conduct in prosecuting the action. A
defendant that acts in ways that unnecessarily prolong or complicate
the litigation so as to increase the plaintiff ’s fees reasonably could be
asked to bear a greater share of that expense.
  8 Relatedly, the majority indicates concern with the District Court’s

lack of explanation for its choice of 10 percent. See ante, at 8. That
procedural failure can easily be remedied by requiring district courts to
explain their apportionment decisions so as to facilitate meaningful
appellate review.

should bear responsibility for payment of those services
(within the bounds set by Congress). In light of these
distinctions, the Court should hesitate to extrapolate
wholesale from the considerations that drove the adoption
of the lodestar rule to constrain the apportionment discre-
tion afforded by §1997e(d)(2).
                             III
  On my reading of the plain text of §1997e(d)(2) and its
surrounding statutory provisions and context, the proper
interpretation of the provision is clear: District courts may
exercise discretion in choosing the portion of the prisoner-
plaintiff ’s monetary judgment that must go toward the
attorney’s fee award, so long as that choice is not greater
than 25 percent of the judgment. Because the majority
holds that a prevailing prisoner-plaintiff must always
yield 25 percent of his monetary judgment or, if less, the
full amount of the fee award in every case, I respectfully
dissent.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
                THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT

 No. 16–1067. Argued December 6, 2017—Decided February 21, 2018
Petitioner Charles Murphy was awarded a judgment in his federal civil
  rights suit against two of his prison guards, including an award of at-
  torney’s fees. Pursuant to 42 U. S. C. §1997e(d)(2), which provides
  that in such cases “a portion of the [prisoner’s] judgment (not to ex-
  ceed 25 percent) shall be applied to satisfy the amount of attorney’s
  fees awarded against the defendant,” the district court ordered Mr.
  Murphy to pay 10% of his judgment toward the fee award, leaving de-
  fendants responsible for the remainder. The Seventh Circuit re-
  versed, holding that §1997e(d)(2) required the district court to ex-
  haust 25% of the prisoner’s judgment before demanding payment
  from the defendants.
Held: In cases governed by §1997e(d), district courts must apply as
 much of the judgment as necessary, up to 25%, to satisfy an award of
 attorney’s fees. The specific statutory language supports the Seventh
 Circuit’s interpretation. First, the mandatory phrase “shall be ap-
 plied” suggests that the district court has some nondiscretionary duty
 to perform. Second, the infinitival phrase “to satisfy the amount of
 attorney’s fees awarded” specifies the purpose or aim of the preceding
 verb’s nondiscretionary duty. Third, “to satisfy” an obligation, espe-
 cially a financial obligation, usually means to discharge the obliga-
 tion in full. Together, these three clues suggest that a district court
 (1) must act (2) with the purpose of (3) fully discharging the fee
 award. And the district court must use as much of the judgment as
 necessary to satisfy the fee award without exceeding the 25% cap.
 Contrary to Mr. Murphy’s suggestion, the district court does not have
 wide discretion to pick any “portion” that does not exceed the 25%
 cap. The larger statutory scheme supports the Seventh Circuit’s in-
 terpretation.    The previously governing provision, 42 U. S. C.
2                           MURPHY v. SMITH

    §1988(b), granted district courts discretion to award fees in unam-
    biguous terms. It is doubtful that Congress, had it wished to confer
    the same sort of discretion in §1997e(d), would have bothered to write
    a new law for prisoner civil rights suits alone; omit all of the words
    that afforded discretion in the old law; and then replace those old dis-
    cretionary words with new mandatory ones. This conclusion is rein-
    forced by §1997e(d)’s surrounding provisions, which like paragraph
    (2), also limit the district court’s pre-existing discretion under
    §1988(b). See, e.g., §§1997e(d)(1)(A) and (B)(ii). The discretion urged
    by Mr. Murphy is exactly the sort of unguided and freewheeling
    choice that this Court has sought to expunge from practice under
    §1988. And his suggested cure for rudderless discretion—to have dis-
    trict courts apportion fees in proportion to the defendant’s culpabil-
    ity—has no basis in the statutory text or roots in the law. Pp. 2–9.

 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

           APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT

                             [February 21, 2018]


  JUSTICE GORSUCH delivered the opinion of the Court.
  This is a case about how much prevailing prisoners
must pay their lawyers. When a prisoner wins a civil
rights suit and the district court awards fees to the pris-
oner’s attorney, a federal statute says that “a portion of
the [prisoner’s] judgment (not to exceed 25 percent) shall
be applied to satisfy the amount of attorney’s fees awarded
against the defendant. If the award of attorney’s fees is
not greater than 150 percent of the judgment, the excess
shall be paid by the defendant.” 42 U. S. C. §1997e(d)(2).
Whatever else you might make of this, the first sentence
pretty clearly tells us that the prisoner has to pay some
part of the attorney’s fee award before financial responsi-
bility shifts to the defendant. But how much is enough?
Does the first sentence allow the district court discretion
to take any amount it wishes from the plaintiff ’s judgment
to pay the attorney, from 25% down to a penny? Or does
the first sentence instead mean that the court must pay
the attorney’s entire fee award from the plaintiff ’s judg-
ment until it reaches the 25% cap and only then turn to
the defendant?
2                    MURPHY v. SMITH

                     Opinion of the Court

   The facts of our case illustrate the problem we face.
After a jury trial, the district court entered judgment for
Charles Murphy in the amount of $307,733.82 against two
of his prison guards, Officer Robert Smith and Lieutenant
Gregory Fulk. The court also awarded Mr. Murphy’s
attorney $108,446.54 in fees. So far, so good. But then
came the question who should pay what portion of the fee
award. The defendants argued that, under the statute’s
terms, the court had to take 25% (or about $77,000) from
Mr. Murphy’s judgment before taxing them for the balance
of the fee award. The court, however, refused that re-
quest. Instead, it ordered that Mr. Murphy “shall pay 10%
of [his] judgment” (or about $31,000) toward the fee
award, with the defendants responsible for the rest. In
support of this allocation, the district court explained that
it commonly varied the amount prisoners pay, though the
court offered no explanation for choosing 10% instead of
some other number. On appeal, a unanimous panel re-
versed, explaining its view that the language of
§1997e(d)(2) requires a district court to exhaust 25% of the
prisoner’s judgment before demanding payment from the
defendants. 844 F. 3d 653, 660 (CA7 2016). So there we
have both sides of the debate, and our question, in a nut-
shell: did the district court have latitude to apply 10% (or
some other discretionary amount) of the plaintiff ’s judg-
ment to his attorney’s fee award instead of 25%? See
582 U. S. ___ (2017) (granting certiorari to resolve this
question).
   As always, we start with the specific statutory language
in dispute. That language (again) says “a portion of the
judgment (not to exceed 25 percent) shall be applied to
satisfy the amount of attorney’s fees awarded.”
§1997e(d)(2). And we think this much tells us a few
things. First, the word “shall” usually creates a mandate,
not a liberty, so the verb phrase “shall be applied” tells us
that the district court has some nondiscretionary duty to
                      Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)                      3

                           Opinion of the Court

perform. See Lexecon Inc. v. Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes
& Lerach, 523 U. S. 26, 35 (1998) (“[T]he mandatory ‘shall’
. . . normally creates an obligation impervious to judicial
discretion”). Second, immediately following the verb we
find an infinitival phrase (“to satisfy the amount of attor-
ney’s fees awarded”) that specifies the purpose or aim of
the verb’s non-discretionary duty. Cf. R. Huddleston &
G. Pullum, Cambridge Grammar of the English Language,
ch. 8, §§1, 12.2, pp. 669, 729–730 (2002). Third, we know
that when you purposefully seek or aim “to satisfy” an
obligation, especially a financial obligation, that usually
means you intend to discharge the obligation in full.1
Together, then, these three clues suggest that the court (1)
must apply judgment funds toward the fee award (2) with
the purpose of (3) fully discharging the fee award. And to
meet that duty, a district court must apply as much of the
judgment as necessary to satisfy the fee award, without of
course exceeding the 25% cap. If Congress had wished to
afford the judge more discretion in this area, it could have
easily substituted “may” for “shall.” And if Congress had
wished to prescribe a different purpose for the judge to
pursue, it could have easily replaced the infinitival phrase
“to satisfy . . . ” with “to reduce . . . ” or “against . . . .” But
Congress didn’t choose those other words. And respect for
Congress’s prerogatives as policymaker means carefully
attending to the words it chose rather than replacing them

4                    MURPHY v. SMITH

                     Opinion of the Court

with others of our own.
   Mr. Murphy’s reply does more to hurt than help his
cause. Consider, he says, college math credits that the
college prospectus says shall be “applied to satisfy” a
chemistry degree. No one, the argument goes, would
understand that phrase to suggest a single math course
will fully discharge all chemistry degree requirements.
We quite agree, but that is beside the point. In Mr. Mur-
phy’s example, as in our statute, the word “satisfy” does
not suggest some hidden empirical judgment about how
often a math class will satisfy a chemistry degree. Instead
it serves to tell the college registrar what purpose he must
pursue when handed the student’s transcript: the regis-
trar must, without discretion, apply those credits toward
the satisfaction or discharge of the student’s credit obliga-
tions. No doubt a college student needing three credits to
graduate who took a three-credit math course would be
bewildered to learn the registrar thought he had discre-
tion to count only two of those credits toward her degree.
So too here. It doesn’t matter how many fee awards will
be fully satisfied from a judgment without breaking the
25% cap, or whether any particular fee award could be.
The statute’s point is to instruct the judge about the pur-
pose he must pursue—to discharge the fee award using
judgment funds to the extent possible, subject to the 25%
cap.
   Retreating now, Mr. Murphy contends that whatever
the verb and the infinitival phrase mean, the subject of
the sentence—“a portion of the judgment (not to exceed 25
percent)”—necessarily suggests wide judicial discretion.
This language, he observes, anticipates a range of
amounts (some “portion” up to 25%) that can be taken
from his judgment. And the existence of the range, Mr.
Murphy contends, necessarily means that the district
court must enjoy discretion to pick any “portion” so long as
it doesn’t exceed the 25% cap.
                 Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)            5

                     Opinion of the Court

   But that does not logically follow. Under either side’s
reading of the statute the portion of fees taken from the
plaintiff ’s judgment will vary over a range—whether
because of the district court’s discretionary choice (as Mr.
Murphy contends), or because of the variance in the size of
fee awards themselves, which sometimes will be less than
25% of the judgment (as Officer Smith and Lieutenant
Fulk suggest). If the police have two suspects in a robbery
committed with a red getaway car, the fact that one sus-
pect drives a red sedan proves nothing if the other does
too. The fact that the statute contemplates a range of
possible “portion[s]” to be paid out of the judgment, thus,
just doesn’t help identify which of the two proposed inter-
pretations we should adopt for both bear that feature.
   Nor does the word “portion” necessarily denote unfet-
tered discretion. If someone told you to follow a written
recipe but double the portion of sugar, you would know
precisely how much sugar to put in—twice whatever’s on
the page. And Congress has certainly used the word
“portion” in just that way. Take 16 U. S. C. §673b, which
defines the National Elk Refuge to include the “[e]ntire
portion now in Jackson Hole National Monument except
that portion in section 2 lying west of the east right-of-way
line of United States Highway Numbered 187,” among
other similar plots—descriptions sufficiently determinate
that the statute itself can later give the total number of
acres of covered land (“six thousand three hundred and
seventy-six acres, more or less”). So the question is how
has Congress used the word “portion” in this statute? And
as we have explained, the text persuades us that, subject
to the 25% cap, the size of the relevant “portion” here is
fixed by reference to the size of the attorney’s fee award,
not left to a district court’s unguided choice.
   Even if the interpretive race in this case seems close at
this point, close races still have winners. Besides, step-
ping back to take in the larger statutory scheme surround-
6                     MURPHY v. SMITH

                      Opinion of the Court

ing the specific language before us reveals that this case
isn’t quite as close as it might first appear. In 1976, Con-
gress enacted what is now 42 U. S. C. §1988(b) to author-
ize discretionary fee shifting in civil rights suits. Civil
Rights Attorney’s Fees Awards Act, 90 Stat. 2641. For
years that statute governed the award of attorney’s fees in
a large variety of civil rights actions, including prisoner
civil rights lawsuits like this one. But in the Prison Liti-
gation Reform Act of 1995, Congress reentered the field
and adopted §1997e’s new and specialized fee shifting
rule for prisoner civil rights suits alone. See 110 Stat.
1321–71.
    Comparing the terms of the old and new statutes helps
to shed a good deal of light on the parties’ positions. Sec-
tion 1988(b) confers discretion on district courts in unam-
biguous terms: “[T]he court, in its discretion, may allow
the prevailing party . . . a reasonable attorney’s fee as part
of the costs” against the defendant. (Emphasis added.)
Meanwhile, §1997e(d) expressly qualifies the usual opera-
tion of §1988(b) in prisoner cases. See §1997e(d)(1)
(providing that “[i]n any action brought by a prisoner . . .
in which attorney’s fees are authorized under section 1988
. . . such fees shall not be awarded, except” under certain
conditions). And as we’ve seen §1997e(d)(2) proceeds to
use very different language to describe the district court’s
job in awarding fees. It does not say “may,” it does not say
“reasonable,” and it certainly does not say anything about
“discretion.” If Congress had wished to confer the same
discretion in §1997e(d) that it conferred in §1988(b), we
very much doubt it would have bothered to write a new
law; omit all the words that afforded discretion in the old
law; and then replace those old discretionary words with
new mandatory ones. See Russello v. United States, 464
U. S. 16, 23 (1983) (refusing to conclude that “the differing
language” in two statutory provisions “has the same
meaning in each”).

                      Opinion of the Court

   The surrounding statutory structure of §1997e(d) rein-
forces this conclusion. Like paragraph (2), the other pro-
visions of §1997e(d) also limit the district court’s pre-
existing discretion under §1988(b). These provisions limit
the fees that would otherwise be available under §1988 to
cover only certain kinds of lawyerly tasks, see
§§1997e(d)(1)(A) and (B)(ii); they require proportionality
between fee awards and the relief ordered, see
§1997e(d)(1)(B)(i); and they restrict the hourly rate of the
prisoner’s lawyer, see §1997e(d)(3). All this suggests a
statute that seeks to restrain, rather than replicate, the
discretion found in §1988(b).
   Notably, too, the discretion Mr. Murphy would have us
introduce into §1997e doesn’t even sit easily with our
precedent under §1988. Our cases interpreting §1988
establish “[a] strong presumption that the lodestar fig-
ure—the product of reasonable hours times a reasonable
rate—represents a ‘reasonable’ fee.” Pennsylvania v.
Delaware Valley Citizens’ Council for Clean Air, 478 U. S.
546, 565 (1986). To be sure, before the lodestar became
“the guiding light of our fee shifting jurisprudence,” Bur-
lington v. Dague, 505 U. S. 557, 562 (1992), many lower
courts used one of your classic 12-factor balancing tests.
See Delaware Valley, 478 U. S., at 562, and n. 7. Ulti-
mately, though, this Court rejected undue reliance on the
12-factor test because it “gave very little actual guidance
to district courts[,] . . . placed unlimited discretion in trial
judges[,] and produced disparate results.” Id., at 563. Yet,
despite this guidance, Mr. Murphy effectively seeks to
(re)introduce into §1997e(d)(2) exactly the sort of unguided
and freewheeling choice—and the disparate results that
come with it—that this Court has sought to expunge from
practice under §1988. And he seeks to achieve all this on
the basis of considerably less helpful statutory language.
To state the suggestion is to reveal its defect.
   Nor does Mr. Murphy’s proposed cure solve his problem.
8                         MURPHY v. SMITH

                          Opinion of the Court

To avoid reading §1997e(d)(2) as affording entirely rudder-
less discretion, Mr. Murphy contends that district courts
should apportion fees in proportion to the defendant’s
culpability. When a defendant has acted egregiously, he
says, the court should lower the plaintiff ’s responsibility
for the fee award and increase the defendant’s—even if
that means applying only a “nominal” amount of the
plaintiff ’s judgment toward the fee. But precisely none of
this appears in §1997e(d)(2) or, for that matter, enjoys any
analogue in §1988’s lodestar analysis or even the old 12-
factor approach. Whatever you might have to say about
Mr. Murphy’s culpability formula as a matter of policy, it
has no roots in the law. Nor is it clear, for what it’s worth,
that the culpability approach would even help him. The
district court never cited the defendants’ culpability (or
any other reason) to justify taking only 10% rather than
25% from Mr. Murphy’s judgment. And it’s tough to see
what the choice of 10% might have had to do with the
defendant’s culpability in this case. The district court
actually remitted the jury’s punitive damages award—
suggesting that, if anything, the defendants’ culpability
had been already amply addressed.
  At the end of the day, what may have begun as a close
race turns out to have a clear winner. Now with a view of
the full field of textual, contextual, and precedential evi-
dence, we think the interpretation the court of appeals
adopted prevails. In cases governed by §1997e(d), we hold
that district courts must apply as much of the judgment as
necessary, up to 25%, to satisfy an award of attorney’s
fees.2
——————
  2 Even for those of us who might be inclined to entertain it, Mr. Mur-

phy’s legislative history argument fails to overcome the textual, contex-
tual, and precedential evidence before us. He points to an early draft of
§1997e(d)(2) that read: “Whenever a monetary judgment is awarded in
an action described in paragraph (1), a portion of the judgment (not to
exceed 25 percent) shall be applied to satisfy the amount of attorney’s

                          Opinion of the Court 


  The judgment is
                                                              Affirmed.

fees awarded against the defendant. If the award of attorney’s fees is
greater than 25 percent of the judgment, the excess shall be paid by the
defendant.” Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995, S. 1279, 104th Cong.,
1st Sess., §3(d), p. 16 (1995) (emphasis added). Mr. Murphy admits
that the italicized language in the second sentence suggests that it is
the size of the attorney’s fees award, not some invisible discretion, that
determines what the defendant must pay. Yet, he notes, the second
sentence was revised in the legislative process and now reads: “If the
award of attorney’s fees is not greater than 150 percent of the judgment,
the excess shall be paid by the defendant.” 42 U. S. C. §1997e(d)(2)
(emphasis added).
   But what exactly does this amendment process prove, even taken on
its own terms? It shows that, at some stage of the bill’s consideration,
its proponents likely shared our understanding that the (still un-
changed) first sentence doesn’t give district courts the discretion to
allocate fees to the defendant as they please. For if such discretion
were intended, it would have been incoherent for the drafters to say, in
the second sentence, that defendants must pay only “[i]f the award of
attorney’s fees is greater than 25 percent of the judgment,” instead of
whenever the district court chooses. Beyond that, the amendment
process tells us nothing. Did legislators voting on the measure agree
with our interpretation of the first sentence and drop the confirmatory
language from the second as flabby duplication? Or did they drop it
because, as Mr. Murphy supposes, they thought it erroneous or even
just bad policy? Did anyone voting on the measure even think about
this question? There is no way to know, and we will not try to guess.

 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

           APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT

                     [February 21, 2018]


  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG,
JUSTICE BREYER, and JUSTICE KAGAN join, dissenting.
  The Court concludes that the attorney’s fee apportion-
ment provision of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995
(PLRA), 42 U. S. C. §1997e(d)(2), requires that a district
court endeavor to fulfill the entirety of an attorney’s fee
award from the monetary judgment awarded to a prevail-
ing prisoner-plaintiff, and only if 25 percent of the judg-
ment is inadequate to cover the fee award can the court
require contribution from the defendant. Ante, at 8. I
cannot agree. The text of §1997e(d)(2)—“a portion of the
judgment (not to exceed 25 percent) shall be applied to
satisfy the amount of attorney’s fees awarded against the
defendant”—and its statutory context make clear that the
provision permits district courts to exercise discretion in
choosing the portion of a prisoner-plaintiff ’s monetary
judgment that must be applied toward an attorney’s fee
award, so long as that portion is not greater than 25 per-
cent. I therefore respectfully dissent.
                             I
  In approaching this case, it helps to understand the
background of the fee award at issue. On July 25, 2011,
petitioner Charles Murphy, a prisoner at the Vandalia
Correctional Center in Illinois, reported that his assigned
2                    MURPHY v. SMITH

                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

seat at mealtime had food and water on it, which resulted
in Murphy being handcuffed and escorted to a segregation
building. Once there, Murphy taunted respondent Correc-
tional Officer Robert Smith, who responded by hitting
Murphy in the eye and applying a choke hold, causing
Murphy to lose consciousness. When Murphy woke up,
Officer Smith and respondent Lieutenant Gregory Fulk
were pushing him into a cell. His hands were still cuffed
behind his back and he fell face-first into the cell and hit
his head on a metal toilet. Officer Smith and Lieutenant
Fulk then stripped Murphy of his clothes, removed his
handcuffs, and left him in the cell without checking his
condition. Thirty or forty minutes passed until a nurse
arrived to attend to Murphy, who was sent to a hospital.
Part of his eye socket had been crushed and required
surgery. Despite the procedure, Murphy did not fully
recover; almost five years later, his vision remained dou-
bled and blurred.
   Murphy sued respondents under 42 U. S. C. §1983 and
state-law causes of action. After trial, a jury found Officer
Smith liable for state-law battery and unconstitutional use
of force under the Eighth Amendment, and found Lieuten-
ant Fulk liable for deliberate indifference to a serious
medical need in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The
jury awarded Murphy $409,750.00 in compensatory and
punitive damages, which the District Court reduced to
$307,733.82. The District Court also awarded Murphy’s
attorney $108,446.54 in fees for the several hundred hours
he spent on the case and, pursuant to §1997e(d)(2), or-
dered Murphy to contribute 10 percent of his money judg-
ment toward the attorney’s fee award and respondents to
pay the rest.
   Respondents appealed, arguing that §1997e(d)(2) re-
quired Murphy to contribute 25 percent of his judgment
toward payment of the attorney’s fee award. The Court of
Appeals for the Seventh Circuit agreed and reversed. In

                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

so doing, it acknowledged that its interpretation of
§1997e(d)(2) was at odds with that of all the other Courts
of Appeals to have considered the question. See 844 F. 3d
653, 660 (2016) (citing Boesing v. Spiess, 540 F. 3d 886,
892 (CA8 2008); Parker v. Conway, 581 F. 3d 198, 205
(CA3 2009)).
                             II

                             A

  The relevant provision in the PLRA provides:
    “Whenever a monetary judgment is awarded in [a
    civil-rights action brought by a prisoner], a portion of
    the judgment (not to exceed 25 percent) shall be ap-
    plied to satisfy the amount of attorney’s fees awarded
    against the defendant. If the award of attorney’s fees
    is not greater than 150 percent of the judgment, the
    excess shall be paid by the defendant.” 42 U. S. C.
    §1997e(d)(2).
   The crux of the majority’s reasoning is its definition of
the infinitive “to satisfy.” The majority contends that
“when you purposefully seek or aim ‘to satisfy’ an obliga-
tion, especially a financial obligation, that usually means
you intend to discharge the obligation in full.” Ante, at 3.
To meet its duty to act with the purpose of fully discharg-
ing the fee award, the majority reasons, “a district court
must apply as much of the judgment as necessary to sat-
isfy the fee award, without of course exceeding the 25%
cap.” Ibid.
   But the phrase “to satisfy” as it is used in §1997e(d)(2)
does not bear the weight the majority places on it. Its
neighboring text and the realities of prisoner-civil-rights
litigation rebut the conclusion that “to satisfy” compels
a district court always to maximize the amount of the
prisoner-plaintiff ’s judgment to be contributed to the fee
award, and instead indicate that the only work “to satisfy”
4                     MURPHY v. SMITH

                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

does in the statute is to direct a district court to contribute
some amount of the judgment toward payment of the fee
award.
   Beginning with the neighboring text, it may well be
that, standing alone, “to satisfy” is often used to mean “to
completely fulfill an obligation.” But the statutory provi-
sion here does not simply say “to satisfy”; it says “applied
to satisfy.” As a matter of everyday usage, the phrase
“applied to satisfy” often means “applied toward the satis-
faction of,” rather than “applied in complete fulfillment
of.” Thus, whereas an action undertaken “to satisfy” an
obligation might, as the majority suggests, naturally be
understood as an effort to discharge the obligation in full,
ante, at 3, a contribution that is “applied to satisfy” an
obligation need not be intended to discharge the obligation
in full.
   Take a few examples: A consumer makes a payment on
her credit card, which her agreement with the card com-
pany provides shall be “applied to satisfy” her debt. A
student enrolls in a particular type of math class, the
credits from which her university registrar earlier an-
nounced shall be “applied to satisfy” the requirements of a
physics degree. And a law firm associate contributes
hours to a pro bono matter that her firm has provided may
be “applied to satisfy” the firm’s overall billable-hours
requirement. In each case, pursuant to the relevant
agreement, the payment, credits, and hours are applied
toward the satisfaction of a larger obligation, but the
inference is not that the consumer, student, or associate
had to contribute or even necessarily did contribute the
maximum possible credit card payment, classroom credits,
or hours toward the fulfillment of those obligations. The
consumer may have chosen to make the minimum credit
card payment because she preferred to allocate her other
funds elsewhere; the student may have chosen the four-
credit version of the math course over the six-credit one
                  Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)              5

                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

because the former had a better instructor; and the asso-
ciate may have been judicious about the hours she dedi-
cated to the pro bono matter because she knew her firm
more highly valued paid over pro bono work. So, too, here.
Section 1997e(d)(2), like the credit card agreement, uni-
versity registrar announcement, and law firm policy, sets
out the relevant rule—“a portion of the judgment (not to
exceed 25 percent) shall be applied to satisfy” the fee
award—and the district court, like the consumer, student,
and law firm associate, decides how much of the judgment
to apply.
   As a practical matter, moreover, a district court will
almost never be able to discharge fully a fee award from
25 percent of a prisoner-plaintiff ’s judgment. In the vast
majority of prisoner-civil-rights cases, the attorney’s fee
award exceeds the monetary judgment awarded to the
prevailing prisoner-plaintiff. In fiscal year 2012, for in-
stance, the median damages award in a prisoner-civil-
rights action litigated to victory (i.e., not settled or decided
against the prisoner) was a mere $4,185. See Schlanger,
Trends in Prisoner Litigation, as the PLRA Enters Adult-
hood, 5 U. C. Irvine L. Rev. 153, 168 (2015) (Table 7)
(Trends in Prisoner Litigation). Therefore, in 2012, the
maximum amount (25 percent) of the median judgment
that could be applied toward an attorney’s fee award was
$1,046.25. The PLRA caps the hourly rate that may be
awarded to a prisoner-plaintiff ’s attorney at 150 percent
of the rate for court-appointed counsel under 18 U. S. C.
§3006A, which in 2012 was $125. 42 U. S. C. §1997e(d)(3);
App. to Pet. for Cert. 21a. Thus, a prisoner’s attorney was
entitled to up to $187.50 per hour worked. Even if a dis-
trict court were to apply an hourly rate of just $100, well
below the cap, unless the attorney put in fewer than 10.5
hours in the ordinary case—a virtually unimaginable
scenario—25 percent of the judgment will not come close
6                         MURPHY v. SMITH

                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

to discharging fully the attorney’s fee award.1
   Such low judgments are not a new phenomenon in
prisoner-civil-rights suits; they were the norm even before
Congress enacted the PLRA. In fiscal year 1993, for ex-
ample, the median damages award for prisoner-plaintiffs
in cases won at trial was $1,000. See Trends in Prisoner
Litigation 167; Schlanger, Inmate Litigation, 116 Harv. L.
Rev. 1555, 1602–1603, and Table II.C (2003).2
   Given the very small judgment awards in successfully
litigated prisoner-civil-rights cases, it is hard to believe, as
the majority contends, that Congress used “applied to
satisfy” to command an effort by district courts to “dis-
charge . . . in full,” ante, at 3, when in most cases, full
discharge will never be possible.3 Rather, taking into
account both the realities of prisoner-civil-rights litigation
and the most natural reading of “applied to satisfy,” the
more logical inference is that §1997e(d)(2) simply requires
that a portion of the prevailing prisoner-plaintiff ’s judg-
ment be applied toward the satisfaction of the attorney’s
fee award.4 It does not, however, demand that the district
court always order the prisoner-plaintiff to pay the maxi-
mum possible portion of the judgment (up to 25 percent)
——————
   1 A similar conclusion obtains if one considers the average, rather

than the median, damages award in a prisoner-civil-rights action
litigated to victory, which in 2012 was $20,815. See Trends in Prisoner
Litigation 168 (Table 7).
   2 The average such award in 1993, excluding one extreme outlier of

$6.5 million, was $18,800. See Trends in Prisoner Litigation 167;
Schlanger, 116 Harv. L. Rev., at 1603.
   3 In fact, even here, where the monetary judgment awarded to Mur-

phy was well above the average award in prisoner-civil-rights cases, 25
percent of the judgment cannot fully discharge the fees awarded to his
attorney.
   4 Irrespective of what portion of the judgment the district court ulti-

mately requires the prisoner-plaintiff to contribute to the fee award, the
award will always be satisfied, i.e., paid in full, for once the prisoner-
plaintiff provides his contribution from the judgment, the defendant
will be called upon to contribute the remainder.

needed to discharge fully the fee award. Under that inter-
pretation, applying any amount of Murphy’s judgment
toward payment of his attorney’s fee award complies with
§1997e(d)(2), whether that amount is 10 percent of the
judgment as ordered by the District Court or 25 percent as
ordered by the Court of Appeals.
                              B
  The majority suggests that if Congress had wanted to
permit judges to pursue something other than full dis-
charge of the fee award from the judgment, it could have
replaced “to satisfy” with “to reduce” or “against.” Ante, at
3. But the majority ignores that Congress also easily
could have written §1997e(d)(2) to more clearly express
the meaning it and respondents champion. The statute,
for example, simply could have said: “Twenty-five percent
of the plaintiff ’s judgment shall be applied to satisfy the
amount of attorney’s fees awarded against the defendant.
If the award of attorney’s fees is not greater than 150
percent of the judgment, the excess shall be paid by the
defendant.”
  In fact, Congress considered and rejected language prior
to enacting the current attorney’s fee apportionment
provision that would have done just what the majority
claims. An earlier version of §1997e(d)(2) provided:
    “Whenever a monetary judgment is awarded in an ac-
    tion described in paragraph (1), a portion of the judg-
    ment (not to exceed 25 percent) shall be applied to sat-
    isfy the amount of attorney’s fees awarded against the
    defendant. If the award of attorney’s fees is greater
    than 25 percent of the judgment, the excess shall be
    paid by the defendant.” Prison Litigation Reform Act
    of 1995, S. 1279, 104th Cong., 1st Sess., §3(d), p. 16
    (1995) (emphasis added).
  The italicized clause plainly expressed what the major-
8                    MURPHY v. SMITH

                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

ity contends the current provision means, i.e., that a de-
fendant’s liability for the attorney’s fee award begins only
if any portion of the award remains unpaid after the pre-
vailing prisoner-plaintiff has contributed 25 percent of the
judgment. But Congress removed this clause before final-
izing the bill, thus electing to keep the 25-percent ceiling
for the prisoner-plaintiff ’s contribution to the fee award
and rejecting a 25-percent floor for the defendant’s contri-
bution. See H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 104–378, p. 71 (1995).
   The majority alternatively disclaims the ability to dis-
cern what motivated the deletion and pronounces that “[i]t
shows that, at some stage of the bill’s consideration, its
proponents likely shared [the majority’s] understanding”
of how the first sentence works. Ante, at 8–9, n. 2. In the
majority’s view, it is more likely that Congress drafted two
redundant sentences than two conflicting ones. Ibid.
That supposition, however, is purely speculative. Here is
what is known for certain: Congress had before it lan-
guage that would have accomplished exactly the statutory
function the majority today endorses and Congress chose
to excise that language from the text. Our precedent
instructs that “[w]here Congress includes limiting lan-
guage in an earlier version of a bill but deletes it prior to
enactment, it may be presumed that the limitation was
not intended.” Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23–
24 (1983). See also INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U. S.
421, 442–443 (1987) (“ ‘Few principles of statutory con-
struction are more compelling than the proposition that
Congress does not intend sub silentio to enact statutory
language that it has earlier discarded in favor of other
language’ ”).
                            C
  The rest of the statutory text confirms that district
courts have discretion to choose the amount of the judg-
ment that must be applied toward the attorney’s fee
                     Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)                    9

                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

award. Specifically, that grant of discretion is evident
from Congress’ use of two discretion-conferring terms,
“portion” and “not to exceed.”
   The first word, “portion,” is defined as “[a] share or
allotted part (as of an estate).” Black’s Law Dictionary
1182 (7th ed. 1999). “Portion” thus inherently conveys an
indeterminate amount. Take, for instance, the following
sentence: “My dinner guest has requested a portion of
apple pie for dessert.” How much is a “portion” of pie? For
a marathon runner, a “portion” might mean a hearty
serving, perhaps an eighth of a whole pie; for someone on
a diet, however, a “portion” might mean a tiny sliver. The
dinner host can figure it out based on the circumstances.
Similarly, in this context, referencing a “portion” of the
judgment tells us that some amount of the judgment up to
25 percent of the whole is to be applied to the attorney’s
fee award, but not exactly what amount. That decision is
left to the sound discretion of the district court, depending
again on the circumstances.
   The majority dismisses as insignificant Congress’ use of
this discretion-conferring term, arguing that under either
side’s reading of the statute, the “portion” of fees taken
from the prisoner-plaintiff ’s judgment will vary. See ante,
at 5. True enough,5 but that fact does not justify the
majority’s brushoff. Congress’ deliberate choice to use the
indeterminate, discretion-conferring term “portion” in
§1997e(d)(2) reveals much about the statute’s meaning.
   To illustrate the significance of Congress’ use of the
word “portion,” imagine that §1997e(d)(2) contained no
qualifying “not to exceed” parenthetical, and instead pro-
——————
   5 Notably, such variation will be far less common under the majority’s

reading. Given that the fee awards in prisoner-civil-rights victories
almost always exceed the monetary judgments, see Part II–A, supra, on
the majority’s reading, it will be the rare case indeed when the “por-
tion” of the judgment applied to the fee award will be anything other
than 25 percent.
10                        MURPHY v. SMITH

                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

vided only that “a portion of the judgment shall be applied
to satisfy the amount of attorney’s fees awarded against
the defendant.” As applied to the typical scenario, i.e.,
where the attorney’s fee award exceeds the prisoner-
plaintiff ’s money judgment, the most natural reading of
the statute absent the limiting parenthetical is that the
amount of the judgment applied to the fee award must be
more than zero and less than 100 percent. That is be-
cause, as explained above, “portion” means something less
than the whole but does not have a fixed value.6 If the
majority were correct in its reading of “to satisfy,” how-
ever—that it requires the district court to endeavor to dis-
charge fully the attorney’s fee award from the prisoner-
plaintiff ’s judgment before turning to the defendant for a
contribution—then, in the typical case, absent the paren-
thetical, we would have to conclude that “a portion of the
judgment” always means “all of the judgment” or perhaps
“all of the judgment save a nominal amount.” I do not
think it reasonable to conclude that Congress intended to
ascribe such a strained meaning to “portion.” That the
majority’s reading of one term—“to satisfy”—forces an
implausible reading of another term—“portion”—strongly
suggests that its reading is incorrect.
  Congress’ use of the word “portion,” therefore, does not
merely instruct that there are a range of possible portions
that can be paid out of the judgment. “Portion” makes
evident that the district court is afforded the discretion to
——————
  6 Of course, “portion” can gain a more determinate meaning by its

surrounding context, as the majority’s examples illustrate. See ante, at
5. But §1997e(d)(2) is not like the recipe that quantifies the initial
portion of sugar to be doubled or the statutory provision that describes
with geographic precision the lands to be made part of the National Elk
Refuge. “[T]o satisfy” simply instructs that some portion of the prisoner-
plaintiff ’s judgment “not to exceed 25 percent” be applied toward the
satisfaction of the fee award. See supra, at 6. Section 1997e(d)(2)
therefore lacks the clarifying details present in the majority’s examples
that would give fixed meaning to the word “portion.”

choose the amount of the judgment to be paid toward the
fee award. The addition of the “not to exceed 25 percent”
parenthetical only enhances this conclusion. The phrase
“not to exceed,” which is itself discretion conferring, sets
an upper, but not a lower, limit and thus cabins, but does
not eliminate, the exercise of discretion that “portion”
confers.
                               D
  The distinction between cabining and eliminating dis-
cretion is also key to understanding the relationship be-
tween §1997e(d) and 42 U. S. C. §1988(b), as well as be-
tween §1997e(d)(2) and its surrounding statutory
provisions.
  Section 1988(b), the Civil Rights Attorney’s Fees Awards
Act of 1976, authorizes a district court to award “a reason-
able attorney’s fee” to a prevailing party in an action to
enforce one or more of several federal civil rights laws.
Section 1997e(d) in turn imposes limits on the attorney’s
fees available under §1988(b) when the prevailing plaintiff
in one of the specified civil-rights actions is a prisoner. In
particular, the district court may award attorney’s fees to
the prisoner only if “the fee was directly and reasonably
incurred in proving an actual violation of the plaintiff ’s
rights protected by a statute pursuant to which a fee may
be awarded under section 1988,” and “the amount of the
fee is proportionately related to the court ordered relief for
the violation” or “the fee was directly and reasonably
incurred in enforcing the relief ordered for the violation.”
§1997e(d)(1). In addition, as noted supra, at 5, the district
court may not base an award of attorney’s fees “on an
hourly rate greater than 150 percent of the hourly rate
established under [18 U. S. C. §3006A] for payment of
court-appointed counsel” and, if the prisoner-plaintiff was
awarded damages, may not award attorney’s fees in excess
of 150 percent of the monetary judgment. §§1997e(d)(2)–

(3).
   These provisions, of course, do not eliminate a district
court’s discretion when it comes to the award of attorney’s
fees to a prevailing prisoner-plaintiff; they merely com-
press the range of permissible options. A district court
still has the discretion to decide whether to award attor-
ney’s fees, just as it ordinarily would under §1988(b); it
simply must first ensure that the threshold conditions set
out in §1997e(d)(1) are satisfied. A district court likewise
still has the discretion to determine what constitutes a
reasonable amount of fees to award; it simply must abide
by the two 150-percent caps in doing so.
   Just as these surrounding statutory provisions in
§1997e(d) set outward bounds on a district court’s exercise
of discretion while still preserving the exercise of discre-
tion within those bounds, so, too, does §1997e(d)(2). A
district court is not free to require the defendant to pay
the entire attorney’s fee award, nor is it free to require the
prisoner-plaintiff to give up more than 25 percent of his
judgment to pay the fee award. But within those bounda-
ries, the district court is free to decide which party should
pay what portion of the fee award.
   The majority suggests that affording discretion to dis-
trict courts when it comes to the apportionment of attor-
ney’s fee awards is in tension with our adoption of the
lodestar method as the presumptive means of calculating
a reasonable fee award under §1988. Ante, at 7. Prior to
the lodestar’s development, several lower courts utilized
12 “sometimes subjective factors.” Pennsylvania v. Dela-
ware Valley Citizens’ Council for Clean Air, 478 U. S. 546,
563 (1986). Because that method “placed unlimited dis-
cretion in trial judges and produced disparate results,”
ibid., this Court endorsed the lodestar approach, pursuant
to which a court multiplies “the number of hours reasona-
bly expended on the litigation times a reasonable hourly
rate,” Blum v. Stenson, 465 U. S. 886, 888 (1984), and then
                  Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)           13

                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

considers whether to make adjustments to that amount,
see id., at 898–901; Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424,
435 (1983). The majority asserts that adopting Murphy’s
reading of §1997e(d)(2) would lead to “exactly the sort of
unguided and freewheeling choice” this Court sought to
leave behind when it sanctioned the lodestar approach.
Ante, at 7. That analogy, however, is inapt.
  First, the question before us is whether §1997e(d)(2)
affords district courts any discretion in the apportionment
of responsibility for payment of an attorney’s fee award,
not how district courts reasonably should exercise that
discretion. When this Court embraced the lodestar ap-
proach, it did so to provide guideposts to district courts as
they exercised the discretion granted to them by §1988(b)
to “allow the prevailing party . . . a reasonable attorney’s
fee.” By no means did this Court eliminate that exercise of
discretion. Rather, the Court has “reemphasize[d] that
the district court has discretion in determining the
amount of a fee award.” Hensley, 461 U. S., at 437; see
also Blum, 465 U. S., at 902, n. 19 (“A district court is
expressly empowered to exercise discretion in determining
whether an award is to be made and if so its reasonable-
ness”); id., at 896 (explaining that the proper standard of
review of an attorney’s fee award is abuse of discretion).
As was the case for the District Court here, that exercise
of discretion can include, for example, whether a defend-
ant is entitled to a reduction in hours where a plaintiff did
not succeed on all his claims, and whether certain claimed
expenses are reasonable. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 22a–
26a.
  If the majority is concerned that district courts are
exercising the apportionment discretion afforded to them
by §1997e(d)(2) in an uneven or unguided manner, the
solution is not to read the conferral of discretion out of the
statute entirely. Instead, as occurred in the §1988(b)
context, the Court could endorse a method for apportion-
14                        MURPHY v. SMITH

                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

ing attorney’s fee awards that can consistently be applied
across cases.7 Just as courts ultimately were capable,
through trial-and-error, of discerning an appropriate
formula for assessing the reasonableness of a given fee
award, see Delaware Valley, 478 U. S., at 562–565, so, too,
are they capable of determining a sound approach to the
apportionment decision envisioned by §1997e(d)(2).8
  Second, even absent an equivalent method to the lode-
star inquiry, §1997e(d)(2) does not, unlike the old 12-factor
analysis for calculating fee awards, afford unlimited dis-
cretion. Congress provided express bounds on a district
court’s apportionment discretion, requiring that it order
the prevailing prisoner-plaintiff to contribute at least
some part of his money judgment to the fee award but no
more than 25 percent.
  Finally, it is not obvious that the need for a more regi-
mented approach with respect to calculating the amount of
an attorney’s fee award under §1988(b) should dictate the
need for a similarly regimented approach with respect to
the apportionment of responsibility for that award under
§1997e(d)(2). The two decisions involve fundamentally
different inquiries: The first is focused on the prevailing-
plaintiff ’s attorney and is concerned with determining a
reasonable value for services rendered in pursuing the
action, and the second is focused on the parties and is
concerned with assessing the extent to which each party
——————
  7 Such  an apportionment method could, for example, account for a
defendant’s conduct during the litigation, just as the lodestar method
considers the prevailing-plaintiff ’s conduct in prosecuting the action. A
defendant that acts in ways that unnecessarily prolong or complicate
the litigation so as to increase the plaintiff ’s fees reasonably could be
asked to bear a greater share of that expense.
  8 Relatedly, the majority indicates concern with the District Court’s

lack of explanation for its choice of 10 percent. See ante, at 8. That
procedural failure can easily be remedied by requiring district courts to
explain their apportionment decisions so as to facilitate meaningful
appellate review.

                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting

should bear responsibility for payment of those services
(within the bounds set by Congress). In light of these
distinctions, the Court should hesitate to extrapolate
wholesale from the considerations that drove the adoption
of the lodestar rule to constrain the apportionment discre-
tion afforded by §1997e(d)(2).
                             III
  On my reading of the plain text of §1997e(d)(2) and its
surrounding statutory provisions and context, the proper
interpretation of the provision is clear: District courts may
exercise discretion in choosing the portion of the prisoner-
plaintiff ’s monetary judgment that must go toward the
attorney’s fee award, so long as that choice is not greater
than 25 percent of the judgment. Because the majority
holds that a prevailing prisoner-plaintiff must always
yield 25 percent of his monetary judgment or, if less, the
full amount of the fee award in every case, I respectfully
dissent.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
                THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT

  No. 16–534.     Argued December 4, 2017—Decided February 21, 2018
The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA) grants foreign
  states and their agencies and instrumentalities immunity from suit
  in the United States and grants their property immunity from at-
  tachment and execution in satisfaction of judgments against them,
  see </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">28</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §§1604, 1609, but with some exceptions. Petitioners
  hold a judgment against respondent Islamic Republic of Iran pursu-
  ant to an exception that applies to foreign states designated as state
  sponsors of terrorism with respect to claims arising out of acts of ter-
  rorism. See §1605A. To enforce that judgment, petitioners filed an
  action in the District Court to attach and execute against certain Ira-
  nian assets—a collection of ancient clay tablets and fragments
  housed at respondent University of Chicago. The District Court con-
  cluded that §1610(g)—which provides that certain property will be
  “subject to attachment in aid of execution, and execution, upon [a
  §1605A] judgment as provided in this section”—does not deprive the
  collection of the immunity typically afforded the property of a foreign
  sovereign. The Seventh Circuit affirmed.
Held: Section 1610(g) does not provide a freestanding basis for parties
  holding a judgment under §1605A to attach and execute against the
  property of a foreign state; rather, for §1610(g) to apply, the immuni-
  ty of the property at issue must be rescinded under a separate provi-
  sion within §1610. Pp. 4–15.
    (a) Congress enacted the FSIA in an effort to codify the careful bal-
  ance between respecting the immunity historically afforded to foreign
  sovereigns and holding them accountable, in certain circumstances,
  for their actions. As a default, foreign states have immunity “from
  the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States and of the States,”
  §1604, but there are express exceptions, including the one at issue
2                RUBIN v. ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN

                                  Syllabus

    here, for state sponsors of terrorism, see §1605A(a). The FSIA simi-
    larly provides as a default that “the property in the United States of
    a foreign state shall be immune from attachment arrest and execu-
    tion.” §1609. But §1610 outlines certain exceptions to this immuni-
    ty. For example, §1610(a)(7) provides that property in the United
    States of a foreign state that is used for a commercial activity in the
    United States shall not be immune from attachment and execution
    where the plaintiff holds a §1605A judgment against the foreign
    state. Before 2008, the FSIA did not expressly address under which
    circumstances a foreign state’s agencies or instrumentalities could be
    held liable for judgments against the state. The Court had addressed
    that question in First Nat. City Bank v. Banco Para el Comercio Exte-
    rior de Cuba, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""110974""><a href=""/opinion/110974/first-nat-city-bank-v-banco-para-el-comercio-exterior-de-cuba/""><span class=""volume"">462</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">611</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 628 (Bancec), and held that, as a default,
    agencies and instrumentalities of a foreign state are separate legal
    entities that cannot be held liable. It recognized the availability of
    exceptions, however, and left the lower courts to determine whether
    an exception applied on a case-by-case basis. The lower courts coa-
    lesced around five relevant factors (the Bancec factors) to assist in
    those determinations. In 2008, Congress amended the FSIA, adding
    §1610(g). Subparagraphs (A) through (E) incorporate almost verba-
    tim the Bancec factors, leaving no dispute that, at a minimum,
    §1610(g) serves to abrogate Bancec where a §1605A judgment holder
    seeks to satisfy a judgment held against the foreign state. The ques-
    tion here is whether, in addition to abrogating Bancec, it provides a
    freestanding exception to property immunity in the context of a
    §1605A judgment. Pp. 4–8.
       (b) The most natural reading of §1610(g)(1)’s phrase “as provided in
    this section” is that it refers to §1610 as a whole, so that §1610(g)(1)
    will apply to property that is exempted from the grant of immunity as
    provided elsewhere in §1610. Those §1610 provisions that do unam-
    biguously revoke the immunity of a foreign state’s property employ
    phrases such as “shall not be immune,” see §1610(a)(7), and
    “[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law,” see §1610(f)(1)(A).
    Such textual markers are conspicuously absent from §1610(g). Thus,
    its phrase “as provided in this section” is best read to signal only that
    a judgment holder seeking to take advantage of §1610(g)(1) must
    identify a basis under one of §1610’s express immunity-abrogating
    provisions to attach and execute against a relevant property. This
    reading provides relief to judgment holders who previously would not
    have been able to attach and execute against property of an agency or
    instrumentality of a foreign state in light of Bancec. It is also con-
    sistent with the basic interpretive canon to construe a statute so as to
    give effect to all of its provisions, see Corley v. United States, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">556</span>
    <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">303</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 314, and with the historical practice of rescinding attach-

  ment and execution immunity primarily in the context of a foreign
  state’s commercial acts, see Verlinden B. V. v. Central Bank of Nige-
  ria, </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""110932""><a href=""/opinion/110932/verlinden-bv-v-central-bank-of-nigeria/""><span class=""volume"">461</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">480</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 487–488. Pp. 8–11.
     (c) Petitioners’ counterarguments are unpersuasive. They assert
  that the phrase “as provided in this section” might refer to the proce-
  dures in §1610(f)(1), which permits §1605A judgment holders to at-
  tach and execute against property associated with certain prohibited
  financial transactions, but which was waived by the President before
  it could take effect. However, it is not logical to read the phrase as
  indicating a congressional intent to create §1610(g) as an alternative
  to §1610(f)(1), particularly since Congress knows how to make clear
  when it is rescinding immunity. Nor could Congress have intended
  “as provided in this section” to refer only to §1610(f)(2)’s instruction
  that the Federal Government assist in identifying assets, since that
  provision does not provide for attachment or execution at all. Finally,
  there is no basis to conclude that “this section” in §1610(g) reflects a
  mere drafting error.
     The words “property of a foreign state,” which appear in the first
  substantive clause of §1610(g), are not rendered superfluous under
  the Court’s reading. Section 1610(g) serves to identify in one place
  all the categories of property that will be available to §1605A judg-
  ment holders for attachment and execution, and commands that the
  availability of such property will not be limited by the Bancec factors.
  Also, without the opening clause, §1610(g) would abrogate the Bancec
  presumption of separateness in all cases, not just those involving ter-
  rorism judgments under §1605A. Although petitioners contend that
  any uncertainty in §1610(g) should be resolved by giving full effect to
  the legislative purpose behind its enactment—removing obstacles to
  enforcing terrorism judgments—they offer no real support for their
  position that §1610(g) was intended to divest all property of a foreign
  state or its agencies or instrumentalities of immunity. Bank Markazi

 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

           APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT

                              [February 21, 2018]


   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.
   The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA)
grants foreign states and their agencies and instrumental-
ities immunity from suit in the United States (called
jurisdictional immunity) and grants their property im-
munity from attachment and execution in satisfaction of
judgments against them. See </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">28</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §§1604, 1609.
But those grants of immunity are subject to exception.
   Petitioners hold a judgment against respondent Islamic
Republic of Iran pursuant to one such exception to juris-
dictional immunity, which applies where the foreign state
is designated as a state sponsor of terrorism and the
claims arise out of acts of terrorism. See §1605A. The
issue presented in this case is whether certain property of
Iran, specifically, a collection of antiquities owned by Iran
but in the possession of respondent University of Chicago,
is subject to attachment and execution by petitioners in
satisfaction of that judgment. Petitioners contend that the
property is stripped of its immunity by another provision
of the FSIA, §1610(g), which they maintain provides a
blanket exception to the immunity typically afforded to
2            RUBIN v. ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN

                        Opinion of the Court

the property of a foreign state where the party seeking to
attach and execute holds a §1605A judgment.
   We disagree. Section 1610(g) serves to identify property
that will be available for attachment and execution in
satisfaction of a §1605A judgment, but it does not in itself
divest property of immunity. Rather, the provision’s
language “as provided in this section” shows that §1610(g)
operates only when the property at issue is exempt from
immunity as provided elsewhere in §1610. Petitioners
cannot invoke §1610(g) to attach and execute against the
antiquities at issue here, which petitioners have not estab-
lished are exempt from immunity under any other provi-
sion in §1610.

  On September 4, 1997, Hamas carried out three suicide
bombings on a crowded pedestrian mall in Jerusalem,
resulting in the deaths of 5 people and injuring nearly 200
others. Petitioners are United States citizens who were
either wounded in the attack or are the close relatives of
those who were injured. In an attempt to recover for their
harm, petitioners sued Iran in the District Court for the
District of Columbia, alleging that Iran was responsible
for the bombing because it provided material support and
training to Hamas. At the time of that action, Iran was
subject to the jurisdiction of the federal courts pursuant to
</pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">28</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §1605(a)(7) (1994 ed., Supp. II), which rescinded
the immunity of foreign states designated as state spon-
sors of terrorism with respect to claims arising out of acts
of terrorism. Iran did not appear in the action, and the
District Court entered a default judgment in favor of
petitioners in the amount of $71.5 million.1

§1605(a)(7) with a separate, more expansive provision addressing the
foreign sovereign immunity of foreign states that are designated as

                         Opinion of the Court

   When Iran did not pay the judgment, petitioners
brought this action in the District Court for the Northern
District of Illinois to attach and execute against certain
Iranian assets located in the United States in satisfaction
of their judgment. Those assets—a collection of approxi-
mately 30,000 clay tablets and fragments containing
ancient writings, known as the Persepolis Collection—are
in the possession of the University of Chicago, housed at
its Oriental Institute. University archeologists recovered
the artifacts during an excavation of the old city of Per-
sepolis in the 1930’s. In 1937, Iran loaned the collection
to the Oriental Institute for research, translation, and
cataloging.2
   Petitioners maintained in the District Court, inter alia,
that §1610(g) of the FSIA renders the Persepolis Collec-
tion subject to attachment and execution. The District
Court concluded otherwise and held that §1610(g) does not

of §1610(g) demonstrates that the provision serves to
identify the property of a foreign state or its agencies or

state sponsors of terrorism, §1605A. See National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (NDAA), §1083(a), 122 Stat. 338–341.
Shortly thereafter, petitioners moved in the District Court for an order
converting their judgment under §1605(a)(7) to one under the new
provision, §1605A, which the District Court granted. See Rubin v.

   2 Petitioners also sought to execute the judgment against three other

collections that are no longer at issue in this case: the Chogha Mish
Collection, the Oriental Institute Collection, and the Herzfeld Collec-
tion. The Chogha Mish Collection has been removed from the territorial
jurisdiction of the federal courts, and the Court of Appeals for the

execution, but it does not in itself divest that property of
immunity. The Court granted certiorari to resolve a split

  We start with a brief review of the historical develop-
ment of foreign sovereign immunity law and the statutory
framework at issue here, as it provides a helpful guide to
our decision. This Court consistently has recognized that
foreign sovereign immunity “is a matter of grace and

sovereigns.” Verlinden, 461 U. S., at 486.
  Prior to 1952, the State Department generally held the
position that foreign states enjoyed absolute immunity
from all actions in the United States. See ibid. But, as
foreign states became more involved in commercial activity
in the United States, the State Department recognized
that such participation “makes necessary a practice which
will enable persons doing business with them to have their
rights determined in the courts.” J. Tate, Changed Policy

                      Opinion of the Court

Concerning the Granting of Sovereign Immunity to For-
eign Governments, 26 Dept. State Bull. 984, 985 (1952).
The Department began to follow the “restrictive” theory of
foreign sovereign immunity in advising courts whether
they should take jurisdiction in any given case. Immunity
typically was afforded in cases involving a foreign sover-
eign’s public acts, but not in “cases arising out of a foreign
state’s strictly commercial acts.” Verlinden, 461 U. S., at
487.
   In 1976, Congress enacted the FSIA in an effort to codify
this careful balance between respecting the immunity
historically afforded to foreign sovereigns and holding
them accountable, in certain circumstances, for their
actions. 90 Stat. 2891, as amended, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">28</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §1602
et seq. “For the most part, the Act” tracks “the restrictive
theory of sovereign immunity.” Verlinden, 461 U. S., at
488. As a default, foreign states enjoy immunity “from the
jurisdiction of the courts of the United States and of the
States.” §1604. But this immunity is subject to certain
express exceptions. For example, in line with the restric-
tive theory, a foreign sovereign will be stripped of jurisdic-
tional immunity when a claim is based upon commercial
activity it carried out in the United States. See, e.g.,
§1605(a)(2). The FSIA also provides that a foreign state
will be subject to suit when it is designated as a state
sponsor of terrorism and damages are sought as a result of
acts of terrorism. See §1605A(a).
   With respect to the immunity of property, the FSIA
similarly provides as a default that “the property in the
United States of a foreign state shall be immune from
attachment arrest and execution.” §1609. But, again,
there are exceptions, and §1610 outlines the circumstances
under which property will not be immune. See §1610. For
example, subsection (a) expressly provides that property
“shall not be immune” from attachment and execution
where, inter alia, it is “used for a commercial activity in the
6           RUBIN v. ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN

                      Opinion of the Court

United States” and the “judgment relates to a claim for
which the foreign state is not immune under section
1605A or section 1605(a)(7) (as such section was in effect
on January 27, 2008), regardless of whether the property
is or was involved with the act upon which the claim is
based.” §1610(a)(7).
   Prior to 2008, the FSIA did not address expressly under
what circumstances, if any, the agencies or instrumentali-
ties of a foreign state could be held liable for judgments
against the state. Faced with that question in First Nat.
City Bank v. Banco Para el Comercio Exterior de Cuba,
</pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""110974""><a href=""/opinion/110974/first-nat-city-bank-v-banco-para-el-comercio-exterior-de-cuba/""><span class=""volume"">462</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">611</span></a></span><pre class=""inline""> (1983) (Bancec), this Court held that “gov-
ernment instrumentalities established as juridical entities
distinct and independent from their sovereign should
normally be treated as such.” Id., at 626–627. Thus, as a
default, those agencies and instrumentalities of a foreign
state were to be considered separate legal entities that
cannot be held liable for acts of the foreign state. See id.,
at 628.
   Nevertheless, the Court recognized that such a stringent
rule should not be without exceptions. The Court suggested
that liability would be warranted, for example, “where
a corporate entity is so extensively controlled by [the
state] that a relationship of principal and agent is created,”
id., at 629, or where recognizing the state and its
agency or instrumentality as distinct entities “would work
fraud or injustice,” ibid. (internal quotation marks omit-
ted). See id., at 630. But the Court declined to develop a
“mechanical formula for determining” when these excep-
tions should apply, id., at 633, leaving lower courts with
the task of assessing the availability of exceptions on a
case-by-case basis. Over time, the Courts of Appeals
coalesced around the following five factors (referred to as
the Bancec factors) to aid in this analysis:
    “(1) the level of economic control by the government;
                Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)           7

                    Opinion of the Court

   “(2) whether the entity’s profits go to the government;
   “(3) the degree to which government officials manage
   the entity or otherwise have a hand in its daily
   affairs;
   “(4) whether the government is the real beneficiary of
   the entity’s conduct; and
   “(5) whether adherence to separate identities would
   entitle the foreign state to benefits in United States
   courts while avoiding its obligations.” Walter Fuller

   (CA9 2002).
  In 2008, Congress amended the FSIA and added
§1610(g). See NDAA §1083(b)(3)(D), 122 Stat. 341–342.
Section 1610(g)(1) provides:
      “(g) Property in Certain Actions.—
      “(1) In general. [T]he property of a foreign state
   against which a judgment is entered under section
   1605A, and the property of an agency or instrumental-
   ity of such a state, including property that is a sepa-
   rate juridical entity or is an interest held directly or
   indirectly in a separate juridical entity, is subject to
   attachment in aid of execution, and execution, upon
   that judgment as provided in this section, regardless
   of—
      “(A) the level of economic control over the property
   by the government of the foreign state;
      “(B) whether the profits of the property go to that
   government;
      “(C) the degree to which officials of that government
   manage the property or otherwise control its daily
   affairs;
      “(D) whether that government is the sole benefi-
   ciary in interest of the property; or
8           RUBIN v. ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN

                     Opinion of the Court

      “(E) whether establishing the property as a separate
    entity would entitle the foreign state to benefits in
    United States courts while avoiding its obligations.”
  Subparagraphs (A) through (E) incorporate almost
verbatim the five Bancec factors, leaving no dispute that,
at a minimum, §1610(g) serves to abrogate Bancec with
respect to the liability of agencies and instrumentalities of
a foreign state where a §1605A judgment holder seeks to
satisfy a judgment held against the foreign state. The
issue at hand is whether §1610(g) does something more;
whether, like the commercial activity exception in
§1610(a)(7), it provides an independent exception to im-
munity so that it allows a §1605A judgment holder to
attach and execute against any property of the foreign
state, regardless of whether the property is deprived of
immunity elsewhere in §1610.
                             II
   We turn first to the text of the statute. Section
1610(g)(1) provides that certain property will be “subject
to attachment in aid of execution, and execution, upon [a
§1605A] judgment as provided in this section.” (Emphasis
added.) The most natural reading is that “this section”
refers to §1610 as a whole, so that §1610(g)(1) will govern
the attachment and execution of property that is exempted
from the grant of immunity as provided elsewhere in
§1610. Cf. Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination
Comm., </pre><span class=""citation"" data-id=""118264""><a href=""/opinion/118264/reno-v-american-arab-anti-discrimination-comm/""><span class=""volume"">525</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">471</span></a></span><pre class=""inline"">, 487 (1999) (noting that the phrase
“[e]xcept as provided in this section” in one subsection
serves to incorporate “the rest of ” the section in which the
subsection appears).
   Other provisions of §1610 unambiguously revoke the
immunity of property of a foreign state, including specifi-
cally where a plaintiff holds a judgment under §1605A,
provided certain express conditions are satisfied. For
example, subsection (a) provides that “property in the
                      Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)                      9

                           Opinion of the Court

United States . . . used for a commercial activity in the
United States . . . shall not be immune” from attachment
and execution in seven enumerated circumstances, includ-
ing when “the judgment relates to a claim for which the
foreign state is not immune under section 1605A . . . .”
§1610(a)(7). Subsections (b), (d), and (e) similarly set out
circumstances in which certain property of a foreign state
“shall not be immune.”4 And two other provisions within
§1610 specifically allow §1605A judgment holders to at-
tach and execute against property of a foreign state,
“[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law,” including
those provisions otherwise granting immunity, but only
with respect to assets associated with certain regulated
and prohibited financial transactions. See §1610(f )(1)(A);
Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA), §201(a), 116
Stat. 2337, note following </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">28</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §1610.
   Section 1610(g) conspicuously lacks the textual markers,
“shall not be immune” or “notwithstanding any other
provision of law,” that would have shown that it serves as
an independent avenue for abrogation of immunity. In
fact, its use of the phrase “as provided in this section”
signals the opposite: A judgment holder seeking to take
advantage of §1610(g)(1) must identify a basis under one
of §1610’s express immunity-abrogating provisions to
attach and execute against a relevant property.
   Reading §1610(g) in this way still provides relief to
judgment holders who previously would not have been
able to attach and execute against property of an agency
or instrumentality of a foreign state in light of this Court’s
decision in Bancec. Suppose, for instance, that plaintiffs
obtain a §1605A judgment against a foreign state and seek
——————
  4 Section 1610(b), for example, provides that “any property . . . of [the]

agency or instrumentality of a foreign state engaged in commercial
activity in the United States shall not be immune” from attachment
and execution in satisfaction of a judgment on a claim for which the
agency or instrumentality is not immune under §1605A. §1610(b)(3).
10            RUBIN v. ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN

                         Opinion of the Court

to collect against the assets located in the United States of
a state-owned telecommunications company. Cf. Alejan-
dre v. Telefonica Larga Distancia de Puerto Rico, Inc., </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">183</span>
<span class=""reporter"">F.3d</span> <span class=""page"">1277</span></span><pre class=""inline""> (CA11 1999). Prior to the enactment of
§1610(g), the plaintiffs would have had to establish that
the Bancec factors favor holding the agency or instrumen-
tality liable for the foreign state’s misconduct. With
§1610(g), however, the plaintiffs could attach and execute
against the property of the state-owned entity regardless
of the Bancec factors, so long as the plaintiffs can establish
that the property is otherwise not immune (e.g., pursuant
to §1610(a)(7) because it is used in commercial activity in
the United States).
   Moreover, our reading of §1610(g)(1) is consistent “with
one of the most basic interpretive canons, that [a] statute
should be construed so that effect is given to all its provi-
sions, so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous,
void or insignificant.” Corley v. United States, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">556</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span>
<span class=""page"">303</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, 314 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). Sec-
tion 1610 expressly references §1605A judgments in its
immunity-abrogating provisions, such as </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">28</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">.
§§1610(a)(7), (b)(3), (f )(1), and §201 of the TRIA, showing
that those provisions extend to §1605A judgment holders’
ability to attach and execute against property. If the
Court were to conclude that §1610(g) establishes a basis
for the withdrawal of property immunity any time a plain-
tiff holds a judgment under §1605A, each of those provi-
sions would be rendered superfluous because a judgment
holder could always turn to §1610(g), regardless of whether
the conditions of any other provision were met.5
——————
  5 To the extent petitioners suggest that those references to §1605A

were inadvertent, see Brief for Petitioners 41–44, the statutory history
further supports the conclusion that §1610(a)(7) applies to §1605A
judgment holders, as the reference to §1605A was added to §1610(a)(7)
in the same Act that created §§1605A and 1610(g). See NDAA
§§1083(a), (b)(3), 122 Stat. 338–342.

                     Opinion of the Court

  The Court’s interpretation of §1610(g) is also consistent
with the historical practice of rescinding attachment and
execution immunity primarily in the context of a foreign
state’s commercial acts. See Verlinden, 461 U. S., at 487–
488. Indeed, the FSIA expressly provides in its findings
and declaration of purpose that
    “[u]nder international law, states are not immune
    from the jurisdiction of foreign courts insofar as their
    commercial activities are concerned, and their com-
    mercial property may be levied upon for the satisfac-
    tion of judgments rendered against them in connec-
    tion with their commercial activities.” §1602.
This focus of the FSIA is reflected within §1610, as subsec-
tions (a), (b), and (d) all outline exceptions to immunity
of property when that property is used for commercial
activity. The Court’s reading of §1610(g) means that
individuals with §1605A judgments against a foreign state
must primarily invoke other provisions revoking the grant
of immunity for property related to commercial activity,
including §1610(a)(7), unless the property is expressly
carved out in an exception that applies “[n]otwithstanding
any other provision of law,” §1610(f )(1)(A); §201(a) of the
TRIA. That result is consistent with the history and
structure of the FSIA.
   Throughout the FSIA, special avenues of relief to vic-
tims of terrorism exist, even absent a nexus to commercial
activity. Where the FSIA goes so far as to divest a foreign
state or property of immunity in relation to terrorism-
related judgments, however, it does so expressly. See
§§1605A, 1610(a)(7), (b)(3), (f )(1)(A); §201(a) of the TRIA.
Out of respect for the delicate balance that Congress
struck in enacting the FSIA, we decline to read into the
statute a blanket abrogation of attachment and execution
immunity for §1605A judgment holders absent a clearer
indication of Congress’ intent.
12             RUBIN v. ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN

                          Opinion of the Court

                              III

                               A

   Petitioners resist that the phrase “as provided in this
section” refers to §1610 as a whole and contend that Con-
gress more likely was referencing a specific provision
within §1610 or a section in the NDAA. That explanation
is unpersuasive.
   Petitioners first assert that “this section” might refer to
procedures contained in §1610(f ). Section 1610(f ) permits
§1605A judgment holders to attach and execute against
property associated with certain regulated and prohibited
financial transactions, §1610(f )(1), and it provides that the
United States Secretary of State and Secretary of the
Treasury will make every effort to assist in “identifying,
locating, and executing against the property of [a] foreign
state or any agency or instrumentality of such state,”
§1610(f )(2). Petitioners point out that paragraph (1) of
subsection (f ) has never come into effect because it was
immediately waived by the President after it was enacted,
pursuant to §1610(f )(3).6 So, the argument goes, it would
make sense that Congress created §1610(g) as an alterna-
tive mechanism to achieve a similar result.7
   This is a strained and unnatural reading of the phrase
“as provided in this section.” In enacting §201(a) of the
TRIA, which, similar to </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">28</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">. §1610(f ), permits
attachment and execution against blocked assets, Con-
gress signaled that it was rescinding immunity by permit-
ting attachment and execution “[n]otwithstanding any
other provision of law.” See §201(a) of the TRIA. Had
——————
  6 Section 1610(f )(3) authorizes the President to waive paragraph (1) of

subsection (f ) “in the interest of national security.” President Clinton
immediately waived the provision, and the waiver has never been
withdrawn. See Pres. Determ. No. 99–1, 63 Fed. Reg. 59201 (1998);
Pres. Determ. No. 2001–03, 65 Fed. Reg. 66483 (2000).

Ninth Circuit in Bennett, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">825</span> <span class=""reporter"">F.3d</span> <span class=""page"">949</span></span><pre class=""inline"">, in support of this position.

                     Opinion of the Court

Congress likewise intended §1610(g) to have such an
effect, it knew how to say so. Cf. Bank Markazi v. Peter-
son, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">578</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">___, ___, n. 2 (2016) (slip op., at 4, n. 2)
(noting that “[s]ection 1610(g) does not take precedence
over ‘any other provision of law,’ as the TRIA does”).
    Petitioners fare no better in arguing that Congress may
have intended “this section” to refer only to the instruction
in §1610(f )(2) that the United States Government assist in
identifying assets. Section 1610(f )(2) does not provide for
attachment or execution at all, so petitioners’ argument
does not account for the lack of textual indicators that
exist in provisions like §§1610(a)(7) and (f )(1) that unam-
biguously abrogate immunity and permit attachment and
execution.
    Finally, petitioners assert that “this section” could
possibly reflect a drafting error that was intended to
actually refer to §1083 of the NDAA, the Public Law in
which §1610(g) was enacted. This interpretation would
require not only a stark deviation from the plain text of
§1610(g), but also a departure from the clear text of the
NDAA. Section 1083(b)(3) of the NDAA provides that
“Section 1610 of title 28, United States Code, is amended
. . . by adding at the end” the new subsection “(g).” 122
Stat. 341. The language “this section” within (g), then,
clearly and expressly incorporates the NDAA’s reference
to “Section 1610” as a whole. There is no basis to conclude
that Congress’ failure to change “this section” in §1610(g)
was the result of a mere drafting error.
                             B
  In an effort to show that §1610(g) does much more than
simply abrogate the Bancec factors, petitioners argue that
the words “property of a foreign state,” which appear in
the first substantive clause of §1610(g), would otherwise
be rendered superfluous because the property of a foreign
state will never be subject to a Bancec inquiry. By its

plain text, §1610(g)(1) permits enforcement of a §1605A
judgment against both the property of a foreign state and
the property of the agencies or instrumentalities of that
foreign state. Because the Bancec factors would never
have applied to the property of a foreign state, petitioners
contend, those words must signal something else: that
§1610(g) provides an independent basis for the withdrawal
of immunity.
   The words “property of a foreign state” accomplish at
least two things, however, that are consistent with the
Court’s understanding of the effect of §1610(g). First,
§1610(g) serves to identify in one place all the categories of
property that will be available to §1605A judgment hold-
ers for attachment and execution, whether it is “property
of the foreign state” or property of its agencies or instru-
mentalities, and commands that the availability of such
property will not be limited by the Bancec factors. So long
as the property is deprived of its immunity “as provided in
[§1610],” all of the types of property identified in §1610(g)
will be available to §1605A judgment holders.
   Second, in the context of the entire phrase, “the property
of a foreign state against which a judgment is entered
under section 1605A,” the words “foreign state” identify
the type of judgment that will invoke application of
§1610(g); specifically, a judgment held against a foreign
state and entered under §1605A. Without this opening
phrase, §1610(g) would abrogate the Bancec presumption
of separateness in all cases, not just those involving terror-
ism judgments under §1605A. The words, “property of a
foreign state,” thus, are not rendered superfluous under
the Court’s reading because they do not merely identify a
category of property that is subject to §1610(g) but also
help inform when §1610(g) will apply in the first place.
Indeed, §1610(g) would make no sense if those words were
removed.

                              C

  All else aside, petitioners contend that any uncertainty
in §1610(g) should be resolved by giving full effect to the
legislative purpose behind its enactment. Petitioners posit
that Congress enacted §1610(g) “with the specific purpose
of removing the remaining obstacles to terrorism judg-
ment enforcement.” Brief for Petitioners 26. In support of
that position, they reference a brief discussion of §1610(g)
in a footnote to the Court’s decision in Bank Markazi, </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">578</span>
<span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page""></span></span><pre class=""inline"">___, that notes that Congress “expand[ed] the avail-
ability of assets for postjudgment execution” when it added
§1610(g) by making “available for execution the property
(whether or not blocked) of a foreign state sponsor of
terrorism, or its agency or instrumentality, to satisfy a
judgment against that state.” Id., at ___, n. 2 (slip op., at
4, n. 2). But Bank Markazi’s characterization of §1610(g)
simply mirrors the text of §1610(g) and is entirely con-
sistent with the Court’s holding today that §1610(g) ex-
pands the assets available for attachment and execution
by abrogating this Court’s decision in Bancec with respect
to judgments held under §1605A. Beyond their citation to
Bank Markazi, petitioners have not directed us to any
evidence that supports their position that §1610(g) was
intended to divest all property of a foreign state or its
agencies or instrumentalities of immunity.
                             IV
  For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that </pre><span class=""citation no-link""><span class=""volume"">28</span> <span class=""reporter"">U.S.</span> <span class=""page"">C</span></span><pre class=""inline"">.
§1610(g) does not provide a freestanding basis for parties
holding a judgment under §1605A to attach and execute
against the property of a foreign state, where the immunity
of the property is not otherwise rescinded under a sepa-
rate provision within §1610. The judgment of the Seventh
Circuit is affirmed.
                                             It is so ordered.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
                THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT

  No. 16–534.     Argued December 4, 2017—Decided February 21, 2018
The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA) grants foreign
  states and their agencies and instrumentalities immunity from suit
  in the United States and grants their property immunity from at-
  tachment and execution in satisfaction of judgments against them,
  see 28 U. S. C. §§1604, 1609, but with some exceptions. Petitioners
  hold a judgment against respondent Islamic Republic of Iran pursu-
  ant to an exception that applies to foreign states designated as state
  sponsors of terrorism with respect to claims arising out of acts of ter-
  rorism. See §1605A. To enforce that judgment, petitioners filed an
  action in the District Court to attach and execute against certain Ira-
  nian assets—a collection of ancient clay tablets and fragments
  housed at respondent University of Chicago. The District Court con-
  cluded that §1610(g)—which provides that certain property will be
  “subject to attachment in aid of execution, and execution, upon [a
  §1605A] judgment as provided in this section”—does not deprive the
  collection of the immunity typically afforded the property of a foreign
  sovereign. The Seventh Circuit affirmed.
Held: Section 1610(g) does not provide a freestanding basis for parties
  holding a judgment under §1605A to attach and execute against the
  property of a foreign state; rather, for §1610(g) to apply, the immuni-
  ty of the property at issue must be rescinded under a separate provi-
  sion within §1610. Pp. 4–15.
    (a) Congress enacted the FSIA in an effort to codify the careful bal-
  ance between respecting the immunity historically afforded to foreign
  sovereigns and holding them accountable, in certain circumstances,
  for their actions. As a default, foreign states have immunity “from
  the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States and of the States,”
  §1604, but there are express exceptions, including the one at issue
2                RUBIN v. ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN

                                  Syllabus

    here, for state sponsors of terrorism, see §1605A(a). The FSIA simi-
    larly provides as a default that “the property in the United States of
    a foreign state shall be immune from attachment arrest and execu-
    tion.” §1609. But §1610 outlines certain exceptions to this immuni-
    ty. For example, §1610(a)(7) provides that property in the United
    States of a foreign state that is used for a commercial activity in the
    United States shall not be immune from attachment and execution
    where the plaintiff holds a §1605A judgment against the foreign
    state. Before 2008, the FSIA did not expressly address under which
    circumstances a foreign state’s agencies or instrumentalities could be
    held liable for judgments against the state. The Court had addressed
    that question in First Nat. City Bank v. Banco Para el Comercio Exte-
    rior de Cuba, 462 U. S. 611, 628 (Bancec), and held that, as a default,
    agencies and instrumentalities of a foreign state are separate legal
    entities that cannot be held liable. It recognized the availability of
    exceptions, however, and left the lower courts to determine whether
    an exception applied on a case-by-case basis. The lower courts coa-
    lesced around five relevant factors (the Bancec factors) to assist in
    those determinations. In 2008, Congress amended the FSIA, adding
    §1610(g). Subparagraphs (A) through (E) incorporate almost verba-
    tim the Bancec factors, leaving no dispute that, at a minimum,
    §1610(g) serves to abrogate Bancec where a §1605A judgment holder
    seeks to satisfy a judgment held against the foreign state. The ques-
    tion here is whether, in addition to abrogating Bancec, it provides a
    freestanding exception to property immunity in the context of a
    §1605A judgment. Pp. 4–8.
       (b) The most natural reading of §1610(g)(1)’s phrase “as provided in
    this section” is that it refers to §1610 as a whole, so that §1610(g)(1)
    will apply to property that is exempted from the grant of immunity as
    provided elsewhere in §1610. Those §1610 provisions that do unam-
    biguously revoke the immunity of a foreign state’s property employ
    phrases such as “shall not be immune,” see §1610(a)(7), and
    “[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law,” see §1610(f)(1)(A).
    Such textual markers are conspicuously absent from §1610(g). Thus,
    its phrase “as provided in this section” is best read to signal only that
    a judgment holder seeking to take advantage of §1610(g)(1) must
    identify a basis under one of §1610’s express immunity-abrogating
    provisions to attach and execute against a relevant property. This
    reading provides relief to judgment holders who previously would not
    have been able to attach and execute against property of an agency or
    instrumentality of a foreign state in light of Bancec. It is also con-
    sistent with the basic interpretive canon to construe a statute so as to
    give effect to all of its provisions, see Corley v. United States, 556
    U. S. 303, 314, and with the historical practice of rescinding attach-
                     Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)                     3

                                Syllabus

  ment and execution immunity primarily in the context of a foreign
  state’s commercial acts, see Verlinden B. V. v. Central Bank of Nige-
  ria, 461 U. S. 480, 487–488. Pp. 8–11.
     (c) Petitioners’ counterarguments are unpersuasive. They assert
  that the phrase “as provided in this section” might refer to the proce-
  dures in §1610(f)(1), which permits §1605A judgment holders to at-
  tach and execute against property associated with certain prohibited
  financial transactions, but which was waived by the President before
  it could take effect. However, it is not logical to read the phrase as
  indicating a congressional intent to create §1610(g) as an alternative
  to §1610(f)(1), particularly since Congress knows how to make clear
  when it is rescinding immunity. Nor could Congress have intended
  “as provided in this section” to refer only to §1610(f)(2)’s instruction
  that the Federal Government assist in identifying assets, since that
  provision does not provide for attachment or execution at all. Finally,
  there is no basis to conclude that “this section” in §1610(g) reflects a
  mere drafting error.
     The words “property of a foreign state,” which appear in the first
  substantive clause of §1610(g), are not rendered superfluous under
  the Court’s reading. Section 1610(g) serves to identify in one place
  all the categories of property that will be available to §1605A judg-
  ment holders for attachment and execution, and commands that the
  availability of such property will not be limited by the Bancec factors.
  Also, without the opening clause, §1610(g) would abrogate the Bancec
  presumption of separateness in all cases, not just those involving ter-
  rorism judgments under §1605A. Although petitioners contend that
  any uncertainty in §1610(g) should be resolved by giving full effect to
  the legislative purpose behind its enactment—removing obstacles to
  enforcing terrorism judgments—they offer no real support for their
  position that §1610(g) was intended to divest all property of a foreign
  state or its agencies or instrumentalities of immunity. Bank Markazi
  v. Peterson, 578 U. S. ___, ___, n. 2, distinguished. Pp. 12–15.

           REPUBLIC OF IRAN, ET AL. 

 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

           APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT

                              [February 21, 2018]


   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.
   The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA)
grants foreign states and their agencies and instrumental-
ities immunity from suit in the United States (called
jurisdictional immunity) and grants their property im-
munity from attachment and execution in satisfaction of
judgments against them. See 28 U. S. C. §§1604, 1609.
But those grants of immunity are subject to exception.
   Petitioners hold a judgment against respondent Islamic
Republic of Iran pursuant to one such exception to juris-
dictional immunity, which applies where the foreign state
is designated as a state sponsor of terrorism and the
claims arise out of acts of terrorism. See §1605A. The
issue presented in this case is whether certain property of
Iran, specifically, a collection of antiquities owned by Iran
but in the possession of respondent University of Chicago,
is subject to attachment and execution by petitioners in
satisfaction of that judgment. Petitioners contend that the
property is stripped of its immunity by another provision
of the FSIA, §1610(g), which they maintain provides a
blanket exception to the immunity typically afforded to
2            RUBIN v. ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN

                        Opinion of the Court

the property of a foreign state where the party seeking to
attach and execute holds a §1605A judgment.
   We disagree. Section 1610(g) serves to identify property
that will be available for attachment and execution in
satisfaction of a §1605A judgment, but it does not in itself
divest property of immunity. Rather, the provision’s
language “as provided in this section” shows that §1610(g)
operates only when the property at issue is exempt from
immunity as provided elsewhere in §1610. Petitioners
cannot invoke §1610(g) to attach and execute against the
antiquities at issue here, which petitioners have not estab-
lished are exempt from immunity under any other provi-
sion in §1610.

                               A

  On September 4, 1997, Hamas carried out three suicide
bombings on a crowded pedestrian mall in Jerusalem,
resulting in the deaths of 5 people and injuring nearly 200
others. Petitioners are United States citizens who were
either wounded in the attack or are the close relatives of
those who were injured. In an attempt to recover for their
harm, petitioners sued Iran in the District Court for the
District of Columbia, alleging that Iran was responsible
for the bombing because it provided material support and
training to Hamas. At the time of that action, Iran was
subject to the jurisdiction of the federal courts pursuant to
28 U. S. C. §1605(a)(7) (1994 ed., Supp. II), which rescinded
the immunity of foreign states designated as state spon-
sors of terrorism with respect to claims arising out of acts
of terrorism. Iran did not appear in the action, and the
District Court entered a default judgment in favor of
petitioners in the amount of $71.5 million.1
——————
  1 Congress amended the FSIA in 2008 and replaced 28 U. S. C.

§1605(a)(7) with a separate, more expansive provision addressing the
foreign sovereign immunity of foreign states that are designated as
                     Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)                   3

                         Opinion of the Court

   When Iran did not pay the judgment, petitioners
brought this action in the District Court for the Northern
District of Illinois to attach and execute against certain
Iranian assets located in the United States in satisfaction
of their judgment. Those assets—a collection of approxi-
mately 30,000 clay tablets and fragments containing
ancient writings, known as the Persepolis Collection—are
in the possession of the University of Chicago, housed at
its Oriental Institute. University archeologists recovered
the artifacts during an excavation of the old city of Per-
sepolis in the 1930’s. In 1937, Iran loaned the collection
to the Oriental Institute for research, translation, and
cataloging.2
   Petitioners maintained in the District Court, inter alia,
that §1610(g) of the FSIA renders the Persepolis Collec-
tion subject to attachment and execution. The District
Court concluded otherwise and held that §1610(g) does not
deprive the Persepolis Collection of the immunity typically
afforded the property of a foreign sovereign. The Court of
Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed. 830 F. 3d 470
(2016). As relevant, the Seventh Circuit held that the text
of §1610(g) demonstrates that the provision serves to
identify the property of a foreign state or its agencies or
——————
state sponsors of terrorism, §1605A. See National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (NDAA), §1083(a), 122 Stat. 338–341.
Shortly thereafter, petitioners moved in the District Court for an order
converting their judgment under §1605(a)(7) to one under the new
provision, §1605A, which the District Court granted. See Rubin v.
Islamic Republic of Iran, 563 F. Supp. 2d 38, 39, n. 3 (DC 2008).
   2 Petitioners also sought to execute the judgment against three other

collections that are no longer at issue in this case: the Chogha Mish
Collection, the Oriental Institute Collection, and the Herzfeld Collec-
tion. The Chogha Mish Collection has been removed from the territorial
jurisdiction of the federal courts, and the Court of Appeals for the
Seventh Circuit determined that the Oriental Institute Collection and
Herzfeld Collection are not property of Iran. See 830 F. 3d 470, 475–
476 (2016). Petitioners do not challenge that decision here.
4             RUBIN v. ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN

                         Opinion of the Court

instrumentalities that are subject to attachment and
execution, but it does not in itself divest that property of
immunity. The Court granted certiorari to resolve a split
among the Courts of Appeals regarding the effect of
§1610(g).3 582 U. S. ___ (2017). We agree with the con-
clusion of the Seventh Circuit, and therefore affirm.
                             B
  We start with a brief review of the historical develop-
ment of foreign sovereign immunity law and the statutory
framework at issue here, as it provides a helpful guide to
our decision. This Court consistently has recognized that
foreign sovereign immunity “is a matter of grace and
comity on the part of the United States.” Verlinden B. V.
v. Central Bank of Nigeria, 461 U. S. 480, 486 (1983);
Schooner Exchange v. McFaddon, 7 Cranch 116, 136
(1812). In determining whether to exercise jurisdiction
over suits against foreign sovereigns, courts traditionally
“deferred to the decisions of the political branches . . . on
whether to take jurisdiction over actions against foreign
sovereigns.” Verlinden, 461 U. S., at 486.
  Prior to 1952, the State Department generally held the
position that foreign states enjoyed absolute immunity
from all actions in the United States. See ibid. But, as
foreign states became more involved in commercial activity
in the United States, the State Department recognized
that such participation “makes necessary a practice which
will enable persons doing business with them to have their
rights determined in the courts.” J. Tate, Changed Policy

                      Opinion of the Court

Concerning the Granting of Sovereign Immunity to For-
eign Governments, 26 Dept. State Bull. 984, 985 (1952).
The Department began to follow the “restrictive” theory of
foreign sovereign immunity in advising courts whether
they should take jurisdiction in any given case. Immunity
typically was afforded in cases involving a foreign sover-
eign’s public acts, but not in “cases arising out of a foreign
state’s strictly commercial acts.” Verlinden, 461 U. S., at
487.
   In 1976, Congress enacted the FSIA in an effort to codify
this careful balance between respecting the immunity
historically afforded to foreign sovereigns and holding
them accountable, in certain circumstances, for their
actions. 90 Stat. 2891, as amended, 28 U. S. C. §1602
et seq. “For the most part, the Act” tracks “the restrictive
theory of sovereign immunity.” Verlinden, 461 U. S., at
488. As a default, foreign states enjoy immunity “from the
jurisdiction of the courts of the United States and of the
States.” §1604. But this immunity is subject to certain
express exceptions. For example, in line with the restric-
tive theory, a foreign sovereign will be stripped of jurisdic-
tional immunity when a claim is based upon commercial
activity it carried out in the United States. See, e.g.,
§1605(a)(2). The FSIA also provides that a foreign state
will be subject to suit when it is designated as a state
sponsor of terrorism and damages are sought as a result of
acts of terrorism. See §1605A(a).
   With respect to the immunity of property, the FSIA
similarly provides as a default that “the property in the
United States of a foreign state shall be immune from
attachment arrest and execution.” §1609. But, again,
there are exceptions, and §1610 outlines the circumstances
under which property will not be immune. See §1610. For
example, subsection (a) expressly provides that property
“shall not be immune” from attachment and execution
where, inter alia, it is “used for a commercial activity in the
6           RUBIN v. ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN

                      Opinion of the Court

United States” and the “judgment relates to a claim for
which the foreign state is not immune under section
1605A or section 1605(a)(7) (as such section was in effect
on January 27, 2008), regardless of whether the property
is or was involved with the act upon which the claim is
based.” §1610(a)(7).
   Prior to 2008, the FSIA did not address expressly under
what circumstances, if any, the agencies or instrumentali-
ties of a foreign state could be held liable for judgments
against the state. Faced with that question in First Nat.
City Bank v. Banco Para el Comercio Exterior de Cuba,
462 U. S. 611 (1983) (Bancec), this Court held that “gov-
ernment instrumentalities established as juridical entities
distinct and independent from their sovereign should
normally be treated as such.” Id., at 626–627. Thus, as a
default, those agencies and instrumentalities of a foreign
state were to be considered separate legal entities that
cannot be held liable for acts of the foreign state. See id.,
at 628.
   Nevertheless, the Court recognized that such a stringent
rule should not be without exceptions. The Court suggested
that liability would be warranted, for example, “where
a corporate entity is so extensively controlled by [the
state] that a relationship of principal and agent is created,”
id., at 629, or where recognizing the state and its
agency or instrumentality as distinct entities “would work
fraud or injustice,” ibid. (internal quotation marks omit-
ted). See id., at 630. But the Court declined to develop a
“mechanical formula for determining” when these excep-
tions should apply, id., at 633, leaving lower courts with
the task of assessing the availability of exceptions on a
case-by-case basis. Over time, the Courts of Appeals
coalesced around the following five factors (referred to as
the Bancec factors) to aid in this analysis:
    “(1) the level of economic control by the government;
                Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)           7

                    Opinion of the Court

   “(2) whether the entity’s profits go to the government;
   “(3) the degree to which government officials manage
   the entity or otherwise have a hand in its daily
   affairs;
   “(4) whether the government is the real beneficiary of
   the entity’s conduct; and
   “(5) whether adherence to separate identities would
   entitle the foreign state to benefits in United States
   courts while avoiding its obligations.” Walter Fuller
   Aircraft Sales, Inc. v. Republic of Philippines, 965
   F. 2d 1375, 1380, n. 7 (CA5 1992); see also Flatow v.
   Islamic Republic of Iran, 308 F. 3d 1065, 1071, n. 9
   (CA9 2002).
  In 2008, Congress amended the FSIA and added
§1610(g). See NDAA §1083(b)(3)(D), 122 Stat. 341–342.
Section 1610(g)(1) provides:
      “(g) Property in Certain Actions.—
      “(1) In general. [T]he property of a foreign state
   against which a judgment is entered under section
   1605A, and the property of an agency or instrumental-
   ity of such a state, including property that is a sepa-
   rate juridical entity or is an interest held directly or
   indirectly in a separate juridical entity, is subject to
   attachment in aid of execution, and execution, upon
   that judgment as provided in this section, regardless
   of—
      “(A) the level of economic control over the property
   by the government of the foreign state;
      “(B) whether the profits of the property go to that
   government;
      “(C) the degree to which officials of that government
   manage the property or otherwise control its daily
   affairs;
      “(D) whether that government is the sole benefi-
   ciary in interest of the property; or
8           RUBIN v. ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN

                     Opinion of the Court

      “(E) whether establishing the property as a separate
    entity would entitle the foreign state to benefits in
    United States courts while avoiding its obligations.”
  Subparagraphs (A) through (E) incorporate almost
verbatim the five Bancec factors, leaving no dispute that,
at a minimum, §1610(g) serves to abrogate Bancec with
respect to the liability of agencies and instrumentalities of
a foreign state where a §1605A judgment holder seeks to
satisfy a judgment held against the foreign state. The
issue at hand is whether §1610(g) does something more;
whether, like the commercial activity exception in
§1610(a)(7), it provides an independent exception to im-
munity so that it allows a §1605A judgment holder to
attach and execute against any property of the foreign
state, regardless of whether the property is deprived of
immunity elsewhere in §1610.
                             II
   We turn first to the text of the statute. Section
1610(g)(1) provides that certain property will be “subject
to attachment in aid of execution, and execution, upon [a
§1605A] judgment as provided in this section.” (Emphasis
added.) The most natural reading is that “this section”
refers to §1610 as a whole, so that §1610(g)(1) will govern
the attachment and execution of property that is exempted
from the grant of immunity as provided elsewhere in
§1610. Cf. Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination
Comm., 525 U. S. 471, 487 (1999) (noting that the phrase
“[e]xcept as provided in this section” in one subsection
serves to incorporate “the rest of ” the section in which the
subsection appears).
   Other provisions of §1610 unambiguously revoke the
immunity of property of a foreign state, including specifi-
cally where a plaintiff holds a judgment under §1605A,
provided certain express conditions are satisfied. For
example, subsection (a) provides that “property in the
                      Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)                      9

                           Opinion of the Court

United States . . . used for a commercial activity in the
United States . . . shall not be immune” from attachment
and execution in seven enumerated circumstances, includ-
ing when “the judgment relates to a claim for which the
foreign state is not immune under section 1605A . . . .”
§1610(a)(7). Subsections (b), (d), and (e) similarly set out
circumstances in which certain property of a foreign state
“shall not be immune.”4 And two other provisions within
§1610 specifically allow §1605A judgment holders to at-
tach and execute against property of a foreign state,
“[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law,” including
those provisions otherwise granting immunity, but only
with respect to assets associated with certain regulated
and prohibited financial transactions. See §1610(f )(1)(A);
Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA), §201(a), 116
Stat. 2337, note following 28 U. S. C. §1610.
   Section 1610(g) conspicuously lacks the textual markers,
“shall not be immune” or “notwithstanding any other
provision of law,” that would have shown that it serves as
an independent avenue for abrogation of immunity. In
fact, its use of the phrase “as provided in this section”
signals the opposite: A judgment holder seeking to take
advantage of §1610(g)(1) must identify a basis under one
of §1610’s express immunity-abrogating provisions to
attach and execute against a relevant property.
   Reading §1610(g) in this way still provides relief to
judgment holders who previously would not have been
able to attach and execute against property of an agency
or instrumentality of a foreign state in light of this Court’s
decision in Bancec. Suppose, for instance, that plaintiffs
obtain a §1605A judgment against a foreign state and seek
——————
  4 Section 1610(b), for example, provides that “any property . . . of [the]

agency or instrumentality of a foreign state engaged in commercial
activity in the United States shall not be immune” from attachment
and execution in satisfaction of a judgment on a claim for which the
agency or instrumentality is not immune under §1605A. §1610(b)(3).
10            RUBIN v. ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN

                         Opinion of the Court

to collect against the assets located in the United States of
a state-owned telecommunications company. Cf. Alejan-
dre v. Telefonica Larga Distancia de Puerto Rico, Inc., 183
F. 3d 1277 (CA11 1999). Prior to the enactment of
§1610(g), the plaintiffs would have had to establish that
the Bancec factors favor holding the agency or instrumen-
tality liable for the foreign state’s misconduct. With
§1610(g), however, the plaintiffs could attach and execute
against the property of the state-owned entity regardless
of the Bancec factors, so long as the plaintiffs can establish
that the property is otherwise not immune (e.g., pursuant
to §1610(a)(7) because it is used in commercial activity in
the United States).
   Moreover, our reading of §1610(g)(1) is consistent “with
one of the most basic interpretive canons, that [a] statute
should be construed so that effect is given to all its provi-
sions, so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous,
void or insignificant.” Corley v. United States, 556 U. S.
303, 314 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). Sec-
tion 1610 expressly references §1605A judgments in its
immunity-abrogating provisions, such as 28 U. S. C.
§§1610(a)(7), (b)(3), (f )(1), and §201 of the TRIA, showing
that those provisions extend to §1605A judgment holders’
ability to attach and execute against property. If the
Court were to conclude that §1610(g) establishes a basis
for the withdrawal of property immunity any time a plain-
tiff holds a judgment under §1605A, each of those provi-
sions would be rendered superfluous because a judgment
holder could always turn to §1610(g), regardless of whether
the conditions of any other provision were met.5
——————
  5 To the extent petitioners suggest that those references to §1605A

were inadvertent, see Brief for Petitioners 41–44, the statutory history
further supports the conclusion that §1610(a)(7) applies to §1605A
judgment holders, as the reference to §1605A was added to §1610(a)(7)
in the same Act that created §§1605A and 1610(g). See NDAA
§§1083(a), (b)(3), 122 Stat. 338–342.
                 Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)           11

                     Opinion of the Court

  The Court’s interpretation of §1610(g) is also consistent
with the historical practice of rescinding attachment and
execution immunity primarily in the context of a foreign
state’s commercial acts. See Verlinden, 461 U. S., at 487–
488. Indeed, the FSIA expressly provides in its findings
and declaration of purpose that
    “[u]nder international law, states are not immune
    from the jurisdiction of foreign courts insofar as their
    commercial activities are concerned, and their com-
    mercial property may be levied upon for the satisfac-
    tion of judgments rendered against them in connec-
    tion with their commercial activities.” §1602.
This focus of the FSIA is reflected within §1610, as subsec-
tions (a), (b), and (d) all outline exceptions to immunity
of property when that property is used for commercial
activity. The Court’s reading of §1610(g) means that
individuals with §1605A judgments against a foreign state
must primarily invoke other provisions revoking the grant
of immunity for property related to commercial activity,
including §1610(a)(7), unless the property is expressly
carved out in an exception that applies “[n]otwithstanding
any other provision of law,” §1610(f )(1)(A); §201(a) of the
TRIA. That result is consistent with the history and
structure of the FSIA.
   Throughout the FSIA, special avenues of relief to vic-
tims of terrorism exist, even absent a nexus to commercial
activity. Where the FSIA goes so far as to divest a foreign
state or property of immunity in relation to terrorism-
related judgments, however, it does so expressly. See
§§1605A, 1610(a)(7), (b)(3), (f )(1)(A); §201(a) of the TRIA.
Out of respect for the delicate balance that Congress
struck in enacting the FSIA, we decline to read into the
statute a blanket abrogation of attachment and execution
immunity for §1605A judgment holders absent a clearer
indication of Congress’ intent.
12             RUBIN v. ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN

                          Opinion of the Court

                              III

                               A

   Petitioners resist that the phrase “as provided in this
section” refers to §1610 as a whole and contend that Con-
gress more likely was referencing a specific provision
within §1610 or a section in the NDAA. That explanation
is unpersuasive.
   Petitioners first assert that “this section” might refer to
procedures contained in §1610(f ). Section 1610(f ) permits
§1605A judgment holders to attach and execute against
property associated with certain regulated and prohibited
financial transactions, §1610(f )(1), and it provides that the
United States Secretary of State and Secretary of the
Treasury will make every effort to assist in “identifying,
locating, and executing against the property of [a] foreign
state or any agency or instrumentality of such state,”
§1610(f )(2). Petitioners point out that paragraph (1) of
subsection (f ) has never come into effect because it was
immediately waived by the President after it was enacted,
pursuant to §1610(f )(3).6 So, the argument goes, it would
make sense that Congress created §1610(g) as an alterna-
tive mechanism to achieve a similar result.7
   This is a strained and unnatural reading of the phrase
“as provided in this section.” In enacting §201(a) of the
TRIA, which, similar to 28 U. S. C. §1610(f ), permits
attachment and execution against blocked assets, Con-
gress signaled that it was rescinding immunity by permit-
ting attachment and execution “[n]otwithstanding any
other provision of law.” See §201(a) of the TRIA. Had
——————
  6 Section 1610(f )(3) authorizes the President to waive paragraph (1) of

subsection (f ) “in the interest of national security.” President Clinton
immediately waived the provision, and the waiver has never been
withdrawn. See Pres. Determ. No. 99–1, 63 Fed. Reg. 59201 (1998);
Pres. Determ. No. 2001–03, 65 Fed. Reg. 66483 (2000).
  7 Petitioners reference the decision of the Court of Appeals for the

Ninth Circuit in Bennett, 825 F. 3d 949, in support of this position.
                 Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)           13

                     Opinion of the Court

Congress likewise intended §1610(g) to have such an
effect, it knew how to say so. Cf. Bank Markazi v. Peter-
son, 578 U. S. ___, ___, n. 2 (2016) (slip op., at 4, n. 2)
(noting that “[s]ection 1610(g) does not take precedence
over ‘any other provision of law,’ as the TRIA does”).
    Petitioners fare no better in arguing that Congress may
have intended “this section” to refer only to the instruction
in §1610(f )(2) that the United States Government assist in
identifying assets. Section 1610(f )(2) does not provide for
attachment or execution at all, so petitioners’ argument
does not account for the lack of textual indicators that
exist in provisions like §§1610(a)(7) and (f )(1) that unam-
biguously abrogate immunity and permit attachment and
execution.
    Finally, petitioners assert that “this section” could
possibly reflect a drafting error that was intended to
actually refer to §1083 of the NDAA, the Public Law in
which §1610(g) was enacted. This interpretation would
require not only a stark deviation from the plain text of
§1610(g), but also a departure from the clear text of the
NDAA. Section 1083(b)(3) of the NDAA provides that
“Section 1610 of title 28, United States Code, is amended
. . . by adding at the end” the new subsection “(g).” 122
Stat. 341. The language “this section” within (g), then,
clearly and expressly incorporates the NDAA’s reference
to “Section 1610” as a whole. There is no basis to conclude
that Congress’ failure to change “this section” in §1610(g)
was the result of a mere drafting error.
                             B
  In an effort to show that §1610(g) does much more than
simply abrogate the Bancec factors, petitioners argue that
the words “property of a foreign state,” which appear in
the first substantive clause of §1610(g), would otherwise
be rendered superfluous because the property of a foreign
state will never be subject to a Bancec inquiry. By its
14          RUBIN v. ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN

                      Opinion of the Court

plain text, §1610(g)(1) permits enforcement of a §1605A
judgment against both the property of a foreign state and
the property of the agencies or instrumentalities of that
foreign state. Because the Bancec factors would never
have applied to the property of a foreign state, petitioners
contend, those words must signal something else: that
§1610(g) provides an independent basis for the withdrawal
of immunity.
   The words “property of a foreign state” accomplish at
least two things, however, that are consistent with the
Court’s understanding of the effect of §1610(g). First,
§1610(g) serves to identify in one place all the categories of
property that will be available to §1605A judgment hold-
ers for attachment and execution, whether it is “property
of the foreign state” or property of its agencies or instru-
mentalities, and commands that the availability of such
property will not be limited by the Bancec factors. So long
as the property is deprived of its immunity “as provided in
[§1610],” all of the types of property identified in §1610(g)
will be available to §1605A judgment holders.
   Second, in the context of the entire phrase, “the property
of a foreign state against which a judgment is entered
under section 1605A,” the words “foreign state” identify
the type of judgment that will invoke application of
§1610(g); specifically, a judgment held against a foreign
state and entered under §1605A. Without this opening
phrase, §1610(g) would abrogate the Bancec presumption
of separateness in all cases, not just those involving terror-
ism judgments under §1605A. The words, “property of a
foreign state,” thus, are not rendered superfluous under
the Court’s reading because they do not merely identify a
category of property that is subject to §1610(g) but also
help inform when §1610(g) will apply in the first place.
Indeed, §1610(g) would make no sense if those words were
removed.

                      Opinion of the Court 


                              C

  All else aside, petitioners contend that any uncertainty
in §1610(g) should be resolved by giving full effect to the
legislative purpose behind its enactment. Petitioners posit
that Congress enacted §1610(g) “with the specific purpose
of removing the remaining obstacles to terrorism judg-
ment enforcement.” Brief for Petitioners 26. In support of
that position, they reference a brief discussion of §1610(g)
in a footnote to the Court’s decision in Bank Markazi, 578
U. S. ___, that notes that Congress “expand[ed] the avail-
ability of assets for postjudgment execution” when it added
§1610(g) by making “available for execution the property
(whether or not blocked) of a foreign state sponsor of
terrorism, or its agency or instrumentality, to satisfy a
judgment against that state.” Id., at ___, n. 2 (slip op., at
4, n. 2). But Bank Markazi’s characterization of §1610(g)
simply mirrors the text of §1610(g) and is entirely con-
sistent with the Court’s holding today that §1610(g) ex-
pands the assets available for attachment and execution
by abrogating this Court’s decision in Bancec with respect
to judgments held under §1605A. Beyond their citation to
Bank Markazi, petitioners have not directed us to any
evidence that supports their position that §1610(g) was
intended to divest all property of a foreign state or its
agencies or instrumentalities of immunity.
                             IV
  For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that 28 U. S. C.
§1610(g) does not provide a freestanding basis for parties
holding a judgment under §1605A to attach and execute
against the property of a foreign state, where the immunity
of the property is not otherwise rescinded under a sepa-
rate provision within §1610. The judgment of the Seventh
Circuit is affirmed.
                                             It is so ordered.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
 STATE OF MONTANA v. STATE OF WYOMING AND
          STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA
                  ON BILL OF COMPLAINT
           No. 137, Orig. Decided February 20, 2018

  The Report of the Special Master is received and or-
dered filed. The proposed judgment and decree are en-
tered. JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or
decision of this case.
                        JUDGMENT
   Judgment is awarded against the State of Wyoming and
in favor of the State of Montana for violations of the Yel-
lowstone River Compact resulting from Wyoming’s reduc-
tion of the volume of water available in the Tongue River
at the Stateline between Wyoming and Montana by 1300
acre feet in 2004 and 56 acre feet in 2006. Judgment is
awarded in the amount of $20,340, together with pre-
judgment and post-judgment interest of seven percent
(7%) per annum from the year of each violation until paid.
Costs are awarded to Montana in the amount of
$67,270.87.
   Wyoming shall pay these damages, interest, and costs in
full not later than 90 days from the date of entry of this
Judgment. Wyoming shall make its payment into an
account specified by Montana to be used for improvements
to the Tongue River Reservoir or related facilities in Mon-
tana. Montana may distribute these funds to a state
agency or program, a political subdivision of the State, a
nonprofit corporation, association, and/or a charitable
organization at the sole discretion of the Montana Attor-
ney General in accordance with the laws of the State of
Montana, with the express condition that the funds be
used for improvements to the Tongue River Reservoir or
related facilities in Montana.
2                 MONTANA v. WYOMING

                         PerDecree
                             Curiam

   Except as herein provided, all claims in Montana’s Bill
of Complaint are denied and dismissed with prejudice.
                          DECREE
                   A. General Provisions
   1. Article V(A) of the Yellowstone River Compact (Com-
pact) protects pre-1950 appropriative rights to the benefi-
cial uses of water of the Yellowstone River System in
Montana from diversions and withdrawals of surface
water and groundwater in Wyoming, whether for direct
use or storage, that are not made pursuant to appropriat-
ive rights in Wyoming existing as of January 1, 1950.
   2. Article V of the Compact, including the protections of
Article V(A), applies to all surface waters tributary to the
Tongue and Powder Rivers (with the exception of the
explicit exclusions set out in Article V(E) of the Compact).
   3. Article V(A) of the Compact does not guarantee Mon-
tana a fixed quantity or flow of water, nor does it limit
Wyoming to the net volume of water actually consumed in
Wyoming prior to January 1, 1950.
   4. Article V(A) of the Compact protects pre-1950 appro-
priative rights only to the extent they are for “beneficial
uses,” as defined in Article II(H) of the Compact, and are
otherwise consistent with the doctrine of appropriation. In
particular, pre-1950 rights are not protected to the extent
they are wasteful under the doctrine of appropriation.
   5. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Decree
or the Compact, the laws of Montana and Wyoming (in-
cluding rules for reservoir accounting) govern the admin-
istration and management of each State’s respective water
rights in the implementation of Article V(A) of the Compact.
                         B. Calls
   1. To protect pre-1950 appropriative rights under Ar-
ticle V(A) of the Compact, Montana must place a call.
Wyoming is not liable for flow or storage impacts that take
                 Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)            3

                            Decree

place when a call is not in effect.
   2. Subject to paragraph B(3), Montana may place a call
on the Tongue River whenever (a) a pre-1950 direct flow
right in Montana is not receiving the water to which it is
entitled, or (b) Montana reasonably believes, based on
substantial evidence, that the Tongue River Reservoir
might not fill before the end of the water year.
   3. Montana cannot place a call under Article V(A) when
it can remedy shortages of pre-1950 appropriators in
Montana through purely intrastate means that do not
prejudice Montana’s other rights under the Compact.
   4. A call need not take any particular form, use any
specific language, or be delivered by or to any particular
official, but should be sufficient to place Wyoming on clear
notice that Montana needs additional water to satisfy its
pre-1950 appropriative rights.
   5. A call is effective upon receipt by Wyoming and con-
tinues in effect until Montana notifies Wyoming that
Montana is lifting the call.
   6. Montana shall promptly notify Wyoming that it is
lifting a call when (a) pre-1950 direct flow rights in Mon-
tana are receiving the water to which they are entitled,
and (b) Montana reasonably believes, based on substantial
evidence, that the Tongue River Reservoir will fill before
the end of the water year. Montana may place a new call
at a later date if the conditions of paragraph B(2) are
again met.
   7. Upon receiving a call, Wyoming shall promptly initi-
ate action to ensure, to the degree physically possible, that
only pre-1950 appropriators in Wyoming are diverting or
storing surface water and only to the degree permitted by
their appropriative rights and this Decree. Wyoming also
shall promptly initiate any action needed to ensure, to the
degree physically possible, that any groundwater
withdrawals under post-January 1, 1950 appropriative
rights are not interfering with the continued enjoyment of
4                  MONTANA v. WYOMING

                         PerDecree
                             Curiam

pre-1950 surface rights in Montana. Wyoming shall be
liable for diversions, storage, or withdrawals in violation
of Article V(A) of the Compact even if it was not physically
possible for Wyoming to prevent the diversions, storage, or
withdrawals during a call (including depletions caused by
groundwater withdrawals occurring before the call).
Where it is initially not physically possible to prevent the
storage of water in violation of Article V(A), Wyoming
shall deliver such water to Montana as soon as it is physi-
cally possible to do so after a request from Montana.
           C. Pre-1950 Appropriative Rights
  1. The Compact assigns the same seniority level to all
pre-1950 water users in Montana and Wyoming. Except
as otherwise provided in this Decree, the exercise of pre-
1950 appropriative rights in Wyoming does not violate the
Compact rights of pre-1950 appropriative rights in Montana.
  2. Article V(A) does not prohibit Montana or Wyoming
from allowing a pre-1950 appropriator to conserve water
through the adoption of improved irrigation techniques
and then use that water to irrigate the lands to which the
specific pre-1950 appropriative right attaches, even when
the increased consumption interferes with pre-1950 uses
in Montana. Article V(A) protects pre-1950 appropriators
in Montana from the use of such conserved water in Wyo-
ming on new lands or for new purposes. Such uses fall
within Article V(B) of the Compact and cannot interfere
with pre-1950 appropriative rights in Montana.
  3. Pre-1950 appropriators in Montana and Wyoming
may change their place of use, type of use, and point of
diversion pursuant to applicable state law, so long as any
such changes do not injure appropriators in the other
States as evaluated at the time of the change.
             D. Wyoming Storage Reservoirs
    1. Post-January 1, 1950 appropriators in Wyoming may
                 Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)           5

                            Decree

not store water when Montana has issued a call, except as
provided in paragraph B(7) of this Decree. Post-January
1, 1950 appropriators in Wyoming may store water during
periods when a call is not in effect.
   2. Water stored under post-January 1, 1950 appropriat-
ive rights in Wyoming when a call is not in effect has been
legally stored under the Compact and can be subsequently
used at any time, including when pre-1950 appropriative
rights in Montana are unsatisfied. The Compact does not
require Wyoming to release such water to Montana in
response to a call.
               E. Tongue River Reservoir
   1. Article V(A) protects Montana’s right to store each
water year (October 1 to September 30) up to, but not
more than, 72,500 acre feet of water in the Tongue River
Reservoir, less carryover storage in excess of 6,571 acre
feet. If the Tongue River Reservoir begins the water year
on October 1 with over 6,571 acre feet of carryover water,
Article V(A) protects Montana’s right to fill the Tongue
River Reservoir to its current capacity of 79,071 acre feet.
   2. Montana must avoid wasting water in its operation of
the Tongue River Reservoir by not permitting outflows
during winter months that are not dictated by good engi-
neering practices. Any wasteful outflows reduce the
amount of water storage protected under Article V(A) for
that water year by an equal volume.
   3. The reasonable range for winter outflows from the
Tongue River Reservoir is 75 to 175 cubic feet per second.
The appropriate outflow at any particular point of time
varies within this range and depends on the specific condi-
tions, including, but not limited to, the needs of down-
stream appropriative water rights and risks such as ice
jams and flooding. Montana enjoys significant discretion
in setting the appropriate outflow within this range and in
other reservoir operations.

                             Curiam

              F. General Reservoir Rules
  1. Article V(A) of the Compact does not protect water
stored exclusively for non-depletive purposes, such as
hydroelectric generation and fish protection.
  2. Montana and Wyoming must operate and regulate
reservoirs on the Tongue River and its tributaries in a
fashion that is generally consistent with the appropriation
laws and rules that govern similar reservoirs elsewhere in
each respective State.
                G. Exchange of Information
   1. Within 30 days of the entry of this Decree, Montana
and Wyoming each shall provide the other State with a
list of its current surface water rights in the Tongue River
basin, including information on which rights are pre-1950
and which are post-January 1, 1950. Montana and Wyo-
ming thereafter will annually inform the other State of
any changes in these water rights, unless such infor-
mation is publicly and readily available to the other State.
   2. If requested, Montana and Wyoming also shall pro-
vide the other State annually with any data available in
the ordinary course of water administration that shows
the location and amount of groundwater pumping in the
Tongue River and Powder River basins, except where the
groundwater is used exclusively for domestic or stock
water uses as defined in Article II of the Compact.
   3. Montana and Wyoming shall exchange information,
as reasonable and appropriate, relevant to the effective
implementation of Article V(A) of the Compact. In partic-
ular, Wyoming in response to a call shall notify Montana
of the actions that it intends to take and has taken in
response to the call, and when requested, provide Mon-
tana with reasonable assurances and documentation of
these actions. In making a call, Montana in turn will
notify Wyoming of any intrastate actions it has taken to
remedy shortages of pre-1950 appropriators, and when
                 Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)           7

                            Decree

requested, provide Wyoming with reasonable assurances
and documentation of these actions.
  4. The Yellowstone River Compact Commission remains
free to modify or supplement the terms of the provisions of
paragraph G of this Decree pursuant to its authority
under the Compact.
     H. Rights of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe
  Nothing in this Decree addresses or determines the
water rights of any Indian Tribe or Indian reservation or
the status of such rights under the Yellowstone River
Compact.
                I. Retention of Jurisdiction
  Any of the parties may apply at the foot of this Decree
for its amendment or for further relief. The Court retains
jurisdiction to entertain such further proceedings, enter
such orders, and issue such writs as it may from time to
time deem necessary or desirable to give proper force and
effect to this Decree.

                  ON BILL OF COMPLAINT
           No. 137, Orig. Decided February 20, 2018

  The Report of the Special Master is received and or-
dered filed. The proposed judgment and decree are en-
tered. JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or
decision of this case.
                        JUDGMENT
   Judgment is awarded against the State of Wyoming and
in favor of the State of Montana for violations of the Yel-
lowstone River Compact resulting from Wyoming’s reduc-
tion of the volume of water available in the Tongue River
at the Stateline between Wyoming and Montana by 1300
acre feet in 2004 and 56 acre feet in 2006. Judgment is
awarded in the amount of $20,340, together with pre-
judgment and post-judgment interest of seven percent
(7%) per annum from the year of each violation until paid.
Costs are awarded to Montana in the amount of
$67,270.87.
   Wyoming shall pay these damages, interest, and costs in
full not later than 90 days from the date of entry of this
Judgment. Wyoming shall make its payment into an
account specified by Montana to be used for improvements
to the Tongue River Reservoir or related facilities in Mon-
tana. Montana may distribute these funds to a state
agency or program, a political subdivision of the State, a
nonprofit corporation, association, and/or a charitable
organization at the sole discretion of the Montana Attor-
ney General in accordance with the laws of the State of
Montana, with the express condition that the funds be
used for improvements to the Tongue River Reservoir or
related facilities in Montana.

                         PerDecree
                             Curiam

   Except as herein provided, all claims in Montana’s Bill
of Complaint are denied and dismissed with prejudice.
                          DECREE
                   A. General Provisions
   1. Article V(A) of the Yellowstone River Compact (Com-
pact) protects pre-1950 appropriative rights to the benefi-
cial uses of water of the Yellowstone River System in
Montana from diversions and withdrawals of surface
water and groundwater in Wyoming, whether for direct
use or storage, that are not made pursuant to appropriat-
ive rights in Wyoming existing as of January 1, 1950.
   2. Article V of the Compact, including the protections of
Article V(A), applies to all surface waters tributary to the
Tongue and Powder Rivers (with the exception of the
explicit exclusions set out in Article V(E) of the Compact).
   3. Article V(A) of the Compact does not guarantee Mon-
tana a fixed quantity or flow of water, nor does it limit
Wyoming to the net volume of water actually consumed in
Wyoming prior to January 1, 1950.
   4. Article V(A) of the Compact protects pre-1950 appro-
priative rights only to the extent they are for “beneficial
uses,” as defined in Article II(H) of the Compact, and are
otherwise consistent with the doctrine of appropriation. In
particular, pre-1950 rights are not protected to the extent
they are wasteful under the doctrine of appropriation.
   5. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Decree
or the Compact, the laws of Montana and Wyoming (in-
cluding rules for reservoir accounting) govern the admin-
istration and management of each State’s respective water
rights in the implementation of Article V(A) of the Compact.
                         B. Calls
   1. To protect pre-1950 appropriative rights under Ar-
ticle V(A) of the Compact, Montana must place a call.
Wyoming is not liable for flow or storage impacts that take
                 Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)            3

                            Decree

place when a call is not in effect.
   2. Subject to paragraph B(3), Montana may place a call
on the Tongue River whenever (a) a pre-1950 direct flow
right in Montana is not receiving the water to which it is
entitled, or (b) Montana reasonably believes, based on
substantial evidence, that the Tongue River Reservoir
might not fill before the end of the water year.
   3. Montana cannot place a call under Article V(A) when
it can remedy shortages of pre-1950 appropriators in
Montana through purely intrastate means that do not
prejudice Montana’s other rights under the Compact.
   4. A call need not take any particular form, use any
specific language, or be delivered by or to any particular
official, but should be sufficient to place Wyoming on clear
notice that Montana needs additional water to satisfy its
pre-1950 appropriative rights.
   5. A call is effective upon receipt by Wyoming and con-
tinues in effect until Montana notifies Wyoming that
Montana is lifting the call.
   6. Montana shall promptly notify Wyoming that it is
lifting a call when (a) pre-1950 direct flow rights in Mon-
tana are receiving the water to which they are entitled,
and (b) Montana reasonably believes, based on substantial
evidence, that the Tongue River Reservoir will fill before
the end of the water year. Montana may place a new call
at a later date if the conditions of paragraph B(2) are
again met.
   7. Upon receiving a call, Wyoming shall promptly initi-
ate action to ensure, to the degree physically possible, that
only pre-1950 appropriators in Wyoming are diverting or
storing surface water and only to the degree permitted by
their appropriative rights and this Decree. Wyoming also
shall promptly initiate any action needed to ensure, to the
degree physically possible, that any groundwater
withdrawals under post-January 1, 1950 appropriative
rights are not interfering with the continued enjoyment of

pre-1950 surface rights in Montana. Wyoming shall be
liable for diversions, storage, or withdrawals in violation
of Article V(A) of the Compact even if it was not physically
possible for Wyoming to prevent the diversions, storage, or
withdrawals during a call (including depletions caused by
groundwater withdrawals occurring before the call).
Where it is initially not physically possible to prevent the
storage of water in violation of Article V(A), Wyoming
shall deliver such water to Montana as soon as it is physi-
cally possible to do so after a request from Montana.
           C. Pre-1950 Appropriative Rights
  1. The Compact assigns the same seniority level to all
pre-1950 water users in Montana and Wyoming. Except
as otherwise provided in this Decree, the exercise of pre-
1950 appropriative rights in Wyoming does not violate the
Compact rights of pre-1950 appropriative rights in Montana.
  2. Article V(A) does not prohibit Montana or Wyoming
from allowing a pre-1950 appropriator to conserve water
through the adoption of improved irrigation techniques
and then use that water to irrigate the lands to which the
specific pre-1950 appropriative right attaches, even when
the increased consumption interferes with pre-1950 uses
in Montana. Article V(A) protects pre-1950 appropriators
in Montana from the use of such conserved water in Wyo-
ming on new lands or for new purposes. Such uses fall
within Article V(B) of the Compact and cannot interfere
with pre-1950 appropriative rights in Montana.
  3. Pre-1950 appropriators in Montana and Wyoming
may change their place of use, type of use, and point of
diversion pursuant to applicable state law, so long as any
such changes do not injure appropriators in the other
States as evaluated at the time of the change.
             D. Wyoming Storage Reservoirs
    1. Post-January 1, 1950 appropriators in Wyoming may
                 Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)           5

                            Decree

not store water when Montana has issued a call, except as
provided in paragraph B(7) of this Decree. Post-January
1, 1950 appropriators in Wyoming may store water during
periods when a call is not in effect.
   2. Water stored under post-January 1, 1950 appropriat-
ive rights in Wyoming when a call is not in effect has been
legally stored under the Compact and can be subsequently
used at any time, including when pre-1950 appropriative
rights in Montana are unsatisfied. The Compact does not
require Wyoming to release such water to Montana in
response to a call.
               E. Tongue River Reservoir
   1. Article V(A) protects Montana’s right to store each
water year (October 1 to September 30) up to, but not
more than, 72,500 acre feet of water in the Tongue River
Reservoir, less carryover storage in excess of 6,571 acre
feet. If the Tongue River Reservoir begins the water year
on October 1 with over 6,571 acre feet of carryover water,
Article V(A) protects Montana’s right to fill the Tongue
River Reservoir to its current capacity of 79,071 acre feet.
   2. Montana must avoid wasting water in its operation of
the Tongue River Reservoir by not permitting outflows
during winter months that are not dictated by good engi-
neering practices. Any wasteful outflows reduce the
amount of water storage protected under Article V(A) for
that water year by an equal volume.
   3. The reasonable range for winter outflows from the
Tongue River Reservoir is 75 to 175 cubic feet per second.
The appropriate outflow at any particular point of time
varies within this range and depends on the specific condi-
tions, including, but not limited to, the needs of down-
stream appropriative water rights and risks such as ice
jams and flooding. Montana enjoys significant discretion
in setting the appropriate outflow within this range and in
other reservoir operations.

tered. JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or
decision of this case.
                        JUDGMENT
   Judgment is awarded against the State of Wyoming and
in favor of the State of Montana for violations of the Yel-
lowstone River Compact resulting from Wyoming’s reduc-
tion of the volume of water available in the Tongue River
at the Stateline between Wyoming and Montana by 1300

Costs are awarded to Montana in the amount of
$67,270.87.
   Wyoming shall pay these damages, interest, and costs in
full not later than 90 days from the date of entry of this
Judgment. Wyoming shall make its payment into an
account specified by Montana to be used for improvements
to the Tongue River Reservoir or related facilities in Mon-

                             Curiam

   Except as herein provided, all claims in Montana’s Bill
of Complaint are denied and dismissed with prejudice.
                          DECREE
                   A. General Provisions
   1. Article V(A) of the Yellowstone River Compact (Com-
pact) protects pre-1950 appropriative rights to the benefi-
cial uses of water of the Yellowstone River System in
Montana from diversions and withdrawals of surface
water and groundwater in Wyoming, whether for direct
use or storage, that are not made pursuant to appropriat-
ive rights in Wyoming existing as of January 1, 1950.
   2. Article V of the Compact, including the protections of
Article V(A), applies to all surface waters tributary to the
Tongue and Powder Rivers (with the exception of the
explicit exclusions set out in Article V(E) of the Compact).
   3. Article V(A) of the Compact does not guarantee Mon-
tana a fixed quantity or flow of water, nor does it limit
Wyoming to the net volume of water actually consumed in
Wyoming prior to January 1, 1950.
   4. Article V(A) of the Compact protects pre-1950 appro-
priative rights only to the extent they are for “beneficial
uses,” as defined in Article II(H) of the Compact, and are
otherwise consistent with the doctrine of appropriation. In
particular, pre-1950 rights are not protected to the extent
they are wasteful under the doctrine of appropriation.
   5. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Decree
or the Compact, the laws of Montana and Wyoming (in-
cluding rules for reservoir accounting) govern the admin-
istration and management of each State’s respective water
rights in the implementation of Article V(A) of the Compact.
                         B. Calls
   1. To protect pre-1950 appropriative rights under Ar-
ticle V(A) of the Compact, Montana must place a call.
Wyoming is not liable for flow or storage impacts that take

                            Decree

place when a call is not in effect.
   2. Subject to paragraph B(3), Montana may place a call
on the Tongue River whenever (a) a pre-1950 direct flow
right in Montana is not receiving the water to which it is
entitled, or (b) Montana reasonably believes, based on
substantial evidence, that the Tongue River Reservoir
might not fill before the end of the water year.
   3. Montana cannot place a call under Article V(A) when
it can remedy shortages of pre-1950 appropriators in
Montana through purely intrastate means that do not
prejudice Montana’s other rights under the Compact.
   4. A call need not take any particular form, use any
specific language, or be delivered by or to any particular
official, but should be sufficient to place Wyoming on clear
notice that Montana needs additional water to satisfy its
pre-1950 appropriative rights.
   5. A call is effective upon receipt by Wyoming and con-
tinues in effect until Montana notifies Wyoming that
Montana is lifting the call.
   6. Montana shall promptly notify Wyoming that it is
lifting a call when (a) pre-1950 direct flow rights in Mon-
tana are receiving the water to which they are entitled,
and (b) Montana reasonably believes, based on substantial
evidence, that the Tongue River Reservoir will fill before
the end of the water year. Montana may place a new call
at a later date if the conditions of paragraph B(2) are
again met.
   7. Upon receiving a call, Wyoming shall promptly initi-
ate action to ensure, to the degree physically possible, that
only pre-1950 appropriators in Wyoming are diverting or
storing surface water and only to the degree permitted by
their appropriative rights and this Decree. Wyoming also
shall promptly initiate any action needed to ensure, to the
degree physically possible, that any groundwater
withdrawals under post-January 1, 1950 appropriative
rights are not interfering with the continued enjoyment of
4                  MONTANA v. WYOMING

                         PerDecree
                             Curiam

pre-1950 surface rights in Montana. Wyoming shall be
liable for diversions, storage, or withdrawals in violation
of Article V(A) of the Compact even if it was not physically
possible for Wyoming to prevent the diversions, storage, or
withdrawals during a call (including depletions caused by
groundwater withdrawals occurring before the call).
Where it is initially not physically possible to prevent the
storage of water in violation of Article V(A), Wyoming
shall deliver such water to Montana as soon as it is physi-
cally possible to do so after a request from Montana.
           C. Pre-1950 Appropriative Rights
  1. The Compact assigns the same seniority level to all
pre-1950 water users in Montana and Wyoming. Except
as otherwise provided in this Decree, the exercise of pre-
1950 appropriative rights in Wyoming does not violate the
Compact rights of pre-1950 appropriative rights in Montana.
  2. Article V(A) does not prohibit Montana or Wyoming
from allowing a pre-1950 appropriator to conserve water
through the adoption of improved irrigation techniques
and then use that water to irrigate the lands to which the
specific pre-1950 appropriative right attaches, even when
the increased consumption interferes with pre-1950 uses
in Montana. Article V(A) protects pre-1950 appropriators
in Montana from the use of such conserved water in Wyo-
ming on new lands or for new purposes. Such uses fall
within Article V(B) of the Compact and cannot interfere
with pre-1950 appropriative rights in Montana.
  3. Pre-1950 appropriators in Montana and Wyoming
may change their place of use, type of use, and point of
diversion pursuant to applicable state law, so long as any
such changes do not injure appropriators in the other
States as evaluated at the time of the change.
             D. Wyoming Storage Reservoirs
    1. Post-January 1, 1950 appropriators in Wyoming may
                 Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)           5

                            Decree

not store water when Montana has issued a call, except as
provided in paragraph B(7) of this Decree. Post-January
1, 1950 appropriators in Wyoming may store water during
periods when a call is not in effect.
   2. Water stored under post-January 1, 1950 appropriat-
ive rights in Wyoming when a call is not in effect has been
legally stored under the Compact and can be subsequently
used at any time, including when pre-1950 appropriative
rights in Montana are unsatisfied. The Compact does not
require Wyoming to release such water to Montana in
response to a call.
               E. Tongue River Reservoir
   1. Article V(A) protects Montana’s right to store each
water year (October 1 to September 30) up to, but not
more than, 72,500 acre feet of water in the Tongue River
Reservoir, less carryover storage in excess of 6,571 acre
feet. If the Tongue River Reservoir begins the water year
on October 1 with over 6,571 acre feet of carryover water,
Article V(A) protects Montana’s right to fill the Tongue
River Reservoir to its current capacity of 79,071 acre feet.
   2. Montana must avoid wasting water in its operation of
the Tongue River Reservoir by not permitting outflows
during winter months that are not dictated by good engi-
neering practices. Any wasteful outflows reduce the
amount of water storage protected under Article V(A) for
that water year by an equal volume.
   3. The reasonable range for winter outflows from the
Tongue River Reservoir is 75 to 175 cubic feet per second.
The appropriate outflow at any particular point of time
varies within this range and depends on the specific condi-
tions, including, but not limited to, the needs of down-
stream appropriative water rights and risks such as ice
jams and flooding. Montana enjoys significant discretion
in setting the appropriate outflow within this range and in
other reservoir operations.

                             Curiam

              F. General Reservoir Rules
  1. Article V(A) of the Compact does not protect water
stored exclusively for non-depletive purposes, such as
hydroelectric generation and fish protection.
  2. Montana and Wyoming must operate and regulate
reservoirs on the Tongue River and its tributaries in a
fashion that is generally consistent with the appropriation
laws and rules that govern similar reservoirs elsewhere in
each respective State.
                G. Exchange of Information
   1. Within 30 days of the entry of this Decree, Montana
and Wyoming each shall provide the other State with a
list of its current surface water rights in the Tongue River
basin, including information on which rights are pre-1950
and which are post-January 1, 1950. Montana and Wyo-
ming thereafter will annually inform the other State of
any changes in these water rights, unless such infor-
mation is publicly and readily available to the other State.
   2. If requested, Montana and Wyoming also shall pro-
vide the other State annually with any data available in
the ordinary course of water administration that shows
the location and amount of groundwater pumping in the
Tongue River and Powder River basins, except where the
groundwater is used exclusively for domestic or stock
water uses as defined in Article II of the Compact.
   3. Montana and Wyoming shall exchange information,
as reasonable and appropriate, relevant to the effective
implementation of Article V(A) of the Compact. In partic-
ular, Wyoming in response to a call shall notify Montana
of the actions that it intends to take and has taken in
response to the call, and when requested, provide Mon-
tana with reasonable assurances and documentation of
these actions. In making a call, Montana in turn will
notify Wyoming of any intrastate actions it has taken to
remedy shortages of pre-1950 appropriators, and when
                 Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)           7

                            Decree

requested, provide Wyoming with reasonable assurances
and documentation of these actions.
  4. The Yellowstone River Compact Commission remains
free to modify or supplement the terms of the provisions of
paragraph G of this Decree pursuant to its authority
under the Compact.
     H. Rights of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe
  Nothing in this Decree addresses or determines the
water rights of any Indian Tribe or Indian reservation or
the status of such rights under the Yellowstone River
Compact.
                I. Retention of Jurisdiction
  Any of the parties may apply at the foot of this Decree
for its amendment or for further relief. The Court retains
jurisdiction to entertain such further proceedings, enter
such orders, and issue such writs as it may from time to
time deem necessary or desirable to give proper force and
effect to this Decree.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
 STATE OF MONTANA v. STATE OF WYOMING AND 

          STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA 

                  ON BILL OF COMPLAINT
           No. 137, Orig. Decided February 20, 2018

  The Report of the Special Master is received and or-
dered filed. The proposed judgment and decree are en-
tered. JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or
decision of this case.
                        JUDGMENT
   Judgment is awarded against the State of Wyoming and
in favor of the State of Montana for violations of the Yel-
lowstone River Compact resulting from Wyoming’s reduc-
tion of the volume of water available in the Tongue River
at the Stateline between Wyoming and Montana by 1300
acre feet in 2004 and 56 acre feet in 2006. Judgment is
awarded in the amount of $20,340, together with pre-
judgment and post-judgment interest of seven percent
(7%) per annum from the year of each violation until paid.
Costs are awarded to Montana in the amount of
$67,270.87.
   Wyoming shall pay these damages, interest, and costs in
full not later than 90 days from the date of entry of this
Judgment. Wyoming shall make its payment into an
account specified by Montana to be used for improvements
to the Tongue River Reservoir or related facilities in Mon-
tana. Montana may distribute these funds to a state
agency or program, a political subdivision of the State, a
nonprofit corporation, association, and/or a charitable
organization at the sole discretion of the Montana Attor-
ney General in accordance with the laws of the State of
Montana, with the express condition that the funds be
used for improvements to the Tongue River Reservoir or
related facilities in Montana.
2                 MONTANA v. WYOMING

                         PerDecree
                             Curiam

   Except as herein provided, all claims in Montana’s Bill
of Complaint are denied and dismissed with prejudice.
                          DECREE
                   A. General Provisions
   1. Article V(A) of the Yellowstone River Compact (Com-
pact) protects pre-1950 appropriative rights to the benefi-
cial uses of water of the Yellowstone River System in
Montana from diversions and withdrawals of surface
water and groundwater in Wyoming, whether for direct
use or storage, that are not made pursuant to appropriat-
ive rights in Wyoming existing as of January 1, 1950.
   2. Article V of the Compact, including the protections of
Article V(A), applies to all surface waters tributary to the
Tongue and Powder Rivers (with the exception of the
explicit exclusions set out in Article V(E) of the Compact).
   3. Article V(A) of the Compact does not guarantee Mon-
tana a fixed quantity or flow of water, nor does it limit
Wyoming to the net volume of water actually consumed in
Wyoming prior to January 1, 1950.
   4. Article V(A) of the Compact protects pre-1950 appro-
priative rights only to the extent they are for “beneficial
uses,” as defined in Article II(H) of the Compact, and are
otherwise consistent with the doctrine of appropriation. In
particular, pre-1950 rights are not protected to the extent
they are wasteful under the doctrine of appropriation.
   5. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Decree
or the Compact, the laws of Montana and Wyoming (in-
cluding rules for reservoir accounting) govern the admin-
istration and management of each State’s respective water
rights in the implementation of Article V(A) of the Compact.
                         B. Calls
   1. To protect pre-1950 appropriative rights under Ar-
ticle V(A) of the Compact, Montana must place a call.
Wyoming is not liable for flow or storage impacts that take
                 Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)            3

                            Decree

place when a call is not in effect.
   2. Subject to paragraph B(3), Montana may place a call
on the Tongue River whenever (a) a pre-1950 direct flow
right in Montana is not receiving the water to which it is
entitled, or (b) Montana reasonably believes, based on
substantial evidence, that the Tongue River Reservoir
might not fill before the end of the water year.
   3. Montana cannot place a call under Article V(A) when
it can remedy shortages of pre-1950 appropriators in
Montana through purely intrastate means that do not
prejudice Montana’s other rights under the Compact.
   4. A call need not take any particular form, use any
specific language, or be delivered by or to any particular
official, but should be sufficient to place Wyoming on clear
notice that Montana needs additional water to satisfy its
pre-1950 appropriative rights.
   5. A call is effective upon receipt by Wyoming and con-
tinues in effect until Montana notifies Wyoming that
Montana is lifting the call.
   6. Montana shall promptly notify Wyoming that it is
lifting a call when (a) pre-1950 direct flow rights in Mon-
tana are receiving the water to which they are entitled,
and (b) Montana reasonably believes, based on substantial
evidence, that the Tongue River Reservoir will fill before
the end of the water year. Montana may place a new call
at a later date if the conditions of paragraph B(2) are
again met.
   7. Upon receiving a call, Wyoming shall promptly initi-
ate action to ensure, to the degree physically possible, that
only pre-1950 appropriators in Wyoming are diverting or
storing surface water and only to the degree permitted by
their appropriative rights and this Decree. Wyoming also
shall promptly initiate any action needed to ensure, to the
degree physically possible, that any groundwater
withdrawals under post-January 1, 1950 appropriative
rights are not interfering with the continued enjoyment of

                         PerDecree
                             Curiam

pre-1950 surface rights in Montana. Wyoming shall be
liable for diversions, storage, or withdrawals in violation
of Article V(A) of the Compact even if it was not physically
possible for Wyoming to prevent the diversions, storage, or
withdrawals during a call (including depletions caused by
groundwater withdrawals occurring before the call).
Where it is initially not physically possible to prevent the
storage of water in violation of Article V(A), Wyoming
shall deliver such water to Montana as soon as it is physi-
cally possible to do so after a request from Montana.
           C. Pre-1950 Appropriative Rights
  1. The Compact assigns the same seniority level to all
pre-1950 water users in Montana and Wyoming. Except
as otherwise provided in this Decree, the exercise of pre-
1950 appropriative rights in Wyoming does not violate the
Compact rights of pre-1950 appropriative rights in Montana.
  2. Article V(A) does not prohibit Montana or Wyoming
from allowing a pre-1950 appropriator to conserve water
through the adoption of improved irrigation techniques
and then use that water to irrigate the lands to which the
specific pre-1950 appropriative right attaches, even when
the increased consumption interferes with pre-1950 uses
in Montana. Article V(A) protects pre-1950 appropriators
in Montana from the use of such conserved water in Wyo-
ming on new lands or for new purposes. Such uses fall
within Article V(B) of the Compact and cannot interfere
with pre-1950 appropriative rights in Montana.
  3. Pre-1950 appropriators in Montana and Wyoming
may change their place of use, type of use, and point of
diversion pursuant to applicable state law, so long as any
such changes do not injure appropriators in the other
States as evaluated at the time of the change.
             D. Wyoming Storage Reservoirs
    1. Post-January 1, 1950 appropriators in Wyoming may
                 Cite as: 583 U. S. ____ (2018)           5

                            Decree

not store water when Montana has issued a call, except as
provided in paragraph B(7) of this Decree. Post-January
1, 1950 appropriators in Wyoming may store water during
periods when a call is not in effect.
   2. Water stored under post-January 1, 1950 appropriat-
ive rights in Wyoming when a call is not in effect has been
legally stored under the Compact and can be subsequently
used at any time, including when pre-1950 appropriative
rights in Montana are unsatisfied. The Compact does not
require Wyoming to release such water to Montana in
response to a call.
               E. Tongue River Reservoir
   1. Article V(A) protects Montana’s right to store each
water year (October 1 to September 30) up to, but not
more than, 72,500 acre feet of water in the Tongue River
Reservoir, less carryover storage in excess of 6,571 acre
feet. If the Tongue River Reservoir begins the water year
on October 1 with over 6,571 acre feet of carryover water,
Article V(A) protects Montana’s right to fill the Tongue
River Reservoir to its current capacity of 79,071 acre feet.
   2. Montana must avoid wasting water in its operation of
the Tongue River Reservoir by not permitting outflows
during winter months that are not dictated by good engi-
